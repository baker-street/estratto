  <para>To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard</para>
  <para>him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses</para>
  <para>and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt</para>
  <para>any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that</para>
  <para>one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but</para>
  <para>admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect</para>
  <para>reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a</para>
  <para>lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never</para>
  <para>spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They</para>
  <para>were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the</para>
  <para>veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner</para>
  <para>to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely</para>
  <para>adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which</para>
  <para>might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a</para>
  <para>sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power</para>
  <para>lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a</para>
  <para>nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and</para>
  <para>that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable</para>
  <para>memory.</para>
