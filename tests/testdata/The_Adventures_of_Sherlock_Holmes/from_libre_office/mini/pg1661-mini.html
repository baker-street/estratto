<pre class="western">To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I
have seldom heard</pre>
<pre class="western">him mention her under any other name. In his
eyes she eclipses</pre>
<pre class="western">and predominates the whole of her sex. It was
not that he felt</pre>
<pre class="western">any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All
emotions, and that</pre>
<pre class="western">one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold,
precise but</pre>
<pre class="western">admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the
most perfect</pre>
<pre class="western">reasoning and observing machine that the world
has seen, but as a</pre>
<pre class="western">lover he would have placed himself in a false
position. He never</pre>
<pre class="western">spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
and a sneer. They</pre>
<pre class="western">were admirable things for the
observer--excellent for drawing the</pre>
<pre class="western">veil from men's motives and actions. But for the
trained reasoner</pre>
<pre class="western">to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
and finely</pre>
<pre class="western">adjusted temperament was to introduce a
distracting factor which</pre>
<pre class="western">might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.
Grit in a</pre>
<pre class="western">sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his
own high-power</pre>
<pre class="western">lenses, would not be more disturbing than a
strong emotion in a</pre>
<pre class="western">nature such as his. And yet there was but one
woman to him, and</pre>
<pre class="western">that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious
and questionable</pre>
<pre class="western">memory.</pre>
