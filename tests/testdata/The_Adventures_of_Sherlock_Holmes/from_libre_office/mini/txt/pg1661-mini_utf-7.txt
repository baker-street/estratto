To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard+AA0-
him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses+AA0-
and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt+AA0-
any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that+AA0-
one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but+AA0-
admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect+AA0-
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a+AA0-
lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never+AA0-
spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They+AA0-
were admirable things for the observer+AC0ALQ-excellent for drawing the+AA0-
veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner+AA0-
to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely+AA0-
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which+AA0-
might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a+AA0-
sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high+AC0-power+AA0-
lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a+AA0-
nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and+AA0-
that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable+AA0-
memory.+AA0-
