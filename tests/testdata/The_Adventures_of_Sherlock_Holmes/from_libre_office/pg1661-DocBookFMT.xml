  <para/>
  <para>To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard</para>
  <para>him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses</para>
  <para>and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt</para>
  <para>any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that</para>
  <para>one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but</para>
  <para>admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect</para>
  <para>reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a</para>
  <para>lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never</para>
  <para>spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They</para>
  <para>were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the</para>
  <para>veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner</para>
  <para>to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely</para>
  <para>adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which</para>
  <para>might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a</para>
  <para>sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power</para>
  <para>lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a</para>
  <para>nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and</para>
  <para>that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable</para>
  <para>memory.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us</para>
  <para>away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the</para>
  <para>home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first</para>
  <para>finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to</para>
  <para>absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of</para>
  <para>society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in</para>
  <para>Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from</para>
  <para>week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the</para>
  <para>drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,</para>
  <para>as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his</para>
  <para>immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in</para>
  <para>following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which</para>
  <para>had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time</para>
  <para>to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons</para>
  <para>to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up</para>
  <para>of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,</para>
  <para>and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so</para>
  <para>delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.</para>
  <para>Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely</para>
  <para>shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of</para>
  <para>my former friend and companion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was</para>
  <para>returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to</para>
  <para>civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I</para>
  <para>passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated</para>
  <para>in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the</para>
  <para>Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes</para>
  <para>again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.</para>
  <para>His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw</para>
  <para>his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</para>
  <para>the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head</para>
  <para>sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who</para>
  <para>knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their</para>
  <para>own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his</para>
  <para>drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new</para>
  <para>problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which</para>
  <para>had formerly been in part my own.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I</para>
  <para>think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly</para>
  <para>eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,</para>
  <para>and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he</para>
  <para>stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular</para>
  <para>introspective fashion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have</para>
  <para>put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Seven!" I answered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,</para>
  <para>I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not</para>
  <para>tell me that you intended to go into harness."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, how do you know?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting</para>
  <para>yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and</para>
  <para>careless servant girl?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly</para>
  <para>have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true</para>
  <para>that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful</para>
  <para>mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you</para>
  <para>deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has</para>
  <para>given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it</para>
  <para>out."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands</para>
  <para>together.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the</para>
  <para>inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,</para>
  <para>the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they</para>
  <para>have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round</para>
  <para>the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.</para>
  <para>Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile</para>
  <para>weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting</para>
  <para>specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a</para>
  <para>gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black</para>
  <para>mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge</para>
  <para>on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted</para>
  <para>his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce</para>
  <para>him to be an active member of the medical profession."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his</para>
  <para>process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I</para>
  <para>remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously</para>
  <para>simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each</para>
  <para>successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you</para>
  <para>explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good</para>
  <para>as yours."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing</para>
  <para>himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.</para>
  <para>The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen</para>
  <para>the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Frequently."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How often?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, some hundreds of times."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then how many are there?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How many? I don't know."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is</para>
  <para>just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,</para>
  <para>because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are</para>
  <para>interested in these little problems, and since you are good</para>
  <para>enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you</para>
  <para>may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,</para>
  <para>pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.</para>
  <para>"It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight</para>
  <para>o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a</para>
  <para>matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of</para>
  <para>the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may</para>
  <para>safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which</para>
  <para>can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all</para>
  <para>quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do</para>
  <para>not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that</para>
  <para>it means?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before</para>
  <para>one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit</para>
  <para>theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.</para>
  <para>What do you deduce from it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was</para>
  <para>written.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,</para>
  <para>endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper</para>
  <para>could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly</para>
  <para>strong and stiff."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an</para>
  <para>English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a</para>
  <para>large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for</para>
  <para>'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a</para>
  <para>customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for</para>
  <para>'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental</para>
  <para>Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.</para>
  <para>"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking</para>
  <para>country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being</para>
  <para>the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous</para>
  <para>glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you</para>
  <para>make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue</para>
  <para>triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you</para>
  <para>note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of</para>
  <para>you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian</para>
  <para>could not have written that. It is the German who is so</para>
  <para>uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover</para>
  <para>what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and</para>
  <para>prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if</para>
  <para>I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and</para>
  <para>grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the</para>
  <para>bell. Holmes whistled.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing</para>
  <para>out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of</para>
  <para>beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in</para>
  <para>this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that I had better go, Holmes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my</para>
  <para>Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity</para>
  <para>to miss it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But your client--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he</para>
  <para>comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best</para>
  <para>attention."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and</para>
  <para>in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there</para>
  <para>was a loud and authoritative tap.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Come in!" said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six</para>
  <para>inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His</para>
  <para>dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked</para>
  <para>upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed</para>
  <para>across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while</para>
  <para>the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined</para>
  <para>with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch</para>
  <para>which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended</para>
  <para>halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with</para>
  <para>rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence</para>
  <para>which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a</para>
  <para>broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper</para>
  <para>part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black</para>
  <para>vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,</para>
  <para>for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower</para>
  <para>part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,</para>
  <para>with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive</para>
  <para>of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a</para>
  <para>strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He</para>
  <para>looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to</para>
  <para>address.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and</para>
  <para>colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me</para>
  <para>in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.</para>
  <para>I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour</para>
  <para>and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most</para>
  <para>extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate</para>
  <para>with you alone."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me</para>
  <para>back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say</para>
  <para>before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said</para>
  <para>he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at</para>
  <para>the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At</para>
  <para>present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it</para>
  <para>may have an influence upon European history."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I promise," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And I."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The</para>
  <para>august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to</para>
  <para>you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have</para>
  <para>just called myself is not exactly my own."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution</para>
  <para>has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense</para>
  <para>scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of</para>
  <para>Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House</para>
  <para>of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself</para>
  <para>down in his armchair and closing his eyes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,</para>
  <para>lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him</para>
  <para>as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.</para>
  <para>Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his</para>
  <para>gigantic client.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he</para>
  <para>remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in</para>
  <para>uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he</para>
  <para>tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You</para>
  <para>are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to</para>
  <para>conceal it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken</para>
  <para>before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich</para>
  <para>Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and</para>
  <para>hereditary King of Bohemia."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down</para>
  <para>once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you</para>
  <para>can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in</para>
  <para>my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not</para>
  <para>confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I</para>
  <para>have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting</para>
  <para>you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a</para>
  <para>lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known</para>
  <para>adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without</para>
  <para>opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of</para>
  <para>docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it</para>
  <para>was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not</para>
  <para>at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography</para>
  <para>sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a</para>
  <para>staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea</para>
  <para>fishes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year</para>
  <para>1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera</para>
  <para>of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in</para>
  <para>London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled</para>
  <para>with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and</para>
  <para>is now desirous of getting those letters back."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely so. But how--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Was there a secret marriage?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No legal papers or certificates?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should</para>
  <para>produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is</para>
  <para>she to prove their authenticity?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is the writing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My private note-paper."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Stolen."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My own seal."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Imitated."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My photograph."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Bought."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We were both in the photograph."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an</para>
  <para>indiscretion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was mad--insane."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have compromised yourself seriously."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It must be recovered."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We have tried and failed."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She will not sell."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Stolen, then."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked</para>
  <para>her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice</para>
  <para>she has been waylaid. There has been no result."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No sign of it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Absolutely none."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the</para>
  <para>photograph?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To ruin me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But how?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am about to be married."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So I have heard."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the</para>
  <para>King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her</para>
  <para>family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a</para>
  <para>doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And Irene Adler?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I</para>
  <para>know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul</para>
  <para>of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and</para>
  <para>the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry</para>
  <para>another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not</para>
  <para>go--none."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am sure."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And why?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the</para>
  <para>betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That</para>
  <para>is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to</para>
  <para>look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in</para>
  <para>London for the present?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the</para>
  <para>Count Von Kramm."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, as to money?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have carte blanche."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Absolutely?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom</para>
  <para>to have that photograph."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And for present expenses?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak</para>
  <para>and laid it on the table.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in</para>
  <para>notes," he said.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and</para>
  <para>handed it to him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the</para>
  <para>photograph a cabinet?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon</para>
  <para>have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,</para>
  <para>as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If</para>
  <para>you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three</para>
  <para>o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>II.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had</para>
  <para>not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the</para>
  <para>house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down</para>
  <para>beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,</para>
  <para>however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his</para>
  <para>inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and</para>
  <para>strange features which were associated with the two crimes which</para>
  <para>I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the</para>
  <para>exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.</para>
  <para>Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my</para>
  <para>friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of</para>
  <para>a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a</para>
  <para>pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the</para>
  <para>quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most</para>
  <para>inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable</para>
  <para>success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to</para>
  <para>enter into my head.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was close upon four before the door opened, and a</para>
  <para>drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an</para>
  <para>inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.</para>
  <para>Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of</para>
  <para>disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it</para>
  <para>was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he</para>
  <para>emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.</para>
  <para>Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in</para>
  <para>front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again</para>
  <para>until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the</para>
  <para>chair.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What is it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I</para>
  <para>employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the</para>
  <para>habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,</para>
  <para>however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this</para>
  <para>morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a</para>
  <para>wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of</para>
  <para>them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found</para>
  <para>Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but</para>
  <para>built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock</para>
  <para>to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well</para>
  <para>furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those</para>
  <para>preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.</para>
  <para>Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window</para>
  <para>could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round</para>
  <para>it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without</para>
  <para>noting anything else of interest.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that</para>
  <para>there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the</para>
  <para>garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,</para>
  <para>and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two</para>
  <para>fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire</para>
  <para>about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in</para>
  <para>the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but</para>
  <para>whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is</para>
  <para>the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the</para>
  <para>Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,</para>
  <para>drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for</para>
  <para>dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.</para>
  <para>Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,</para>
  <para>handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and</para>
  <para>often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See</para>
  <para>the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him</para>
  <para>home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.</para>
  <para>When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up</para>
  <para>and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan</para>
  <para>of campaign.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the</para>
  <para>matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the</para>
  <para>relation between them, and what the object of his repeated</para>
  <para>visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the</para>
  <para>former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his</para>
  <para>keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this</para>
  <para>question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony</para>
  <para>Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the</para>
  <para>Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my</para>
  <para>inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to</para>
  <para>let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the</para>
  <para>situation."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am following you closely," I answered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab</para>
  <para>drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a</para>
  <para>remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently</para>
  <para>the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a</para>
  <para>great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the</para>
  <para>maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly</para>
  <para>at home.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch</para>
  <para>glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and</para>
  <para>down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see</para>
  <para>nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than</para>
  <para>before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from</para>
  <para>his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he</para>
  <para>shouted, 'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to</para>
  <para>the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if</para>
  <para>you do it in twenty minutes!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do</para>
  <para>well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,</para>
  <para>the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under</para>
  <para>his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of</para>
  <para>the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall</para>
  <para>door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,</para>
  <para>but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a</para>
  <para>sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing</para>
  <para>whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her</para>
  <para>landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked</para>
  <para>twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could</para>
  <para>object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign</para>
  <para>if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to</para>
  <para>twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the</para>
  <para>others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their</para>
  <para>steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid</para>
  <para>the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there</para>
  <para>save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who</para>
  <para>seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three</para>
  <para>standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side</para>
  <para>aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.</para>
  <para>Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to</para>
  <para>me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards</para>
  <para>me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What then?' I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was</para>
  <para>I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,</para>
  <para>and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally</para>
  <para>assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to</para>
  <para>Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and</para>
  <para>there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady</para>
  <para>on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was</para>
  <para>the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my</para>
  <para>life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just</para>
  <para>now. It seems that there had been some informality about their</para>
  <para>license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them</para>
  <para>without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance</para>
  <para>saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in</para>
  <para>search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean</para>
  <para>to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what</para>
  <para>then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if</para>
  <para>the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate</para>
  <para>very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church</para>
  <para>door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and</para>
  <para>she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as</para>
  <para>usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove</para>
  <para>away in different directions, and I went off to make my own</para>
  <para>arrangements."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Which are?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the</para>
  <para>bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to</para>
  <para>be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want</para>
  <para>your co-operation."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall be delighted."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You don't mind breaking the law?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not in the least."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nor running a chance of arrest?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not in a good cause."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, the cause is excellent!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I am your man."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was sure that I might rely on you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But what is it you wish?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to</para>
  <para>you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that</para>
  <para>our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I</para>
  <para>have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must</para>
  <para>be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns</para>
  <para>from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And what then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to</para>
  <para>occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must</para>
  <para>not interfere, come what may. You understand?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am to be neutral?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small</para>
  <para>unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being</para>
  <para>conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the</para>
  <para>sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close</para>
  <para>to that open window."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what</para>
  <para>I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of</para>
  <para>fire. You quite follow me?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Entirely."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped</para>
  <para>roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,</para>
  <para>fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.</para>
  <para>Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,</para>
  <para>it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then</para>
  <para>walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten</para>
  <para>minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,</para>
  <para>and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry</para>
  <para>of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then you may entirely rely on me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I</para>
  <para>prepare for the new role I have to play."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in</para>
  <para>the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist</para>
  <para>clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white</para>
  <para>tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and</para>
  <para>benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have</para>
  <para>equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His</para>
  <para>expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every</para>
  <para>fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as</para>
  <para>science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in</para>
  <para>crime.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still</para>
  <para>wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in</para>
  <para>Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just</para>
  <para>being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,</para>
  <para>waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such</para>
  <para>as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,</para>
  <para>but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On</para>
  <para>the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was</para>
  <para>remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men</para>
  <para>smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his</para>
  <para>wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and</para>
  <para>several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with</para>
  <para>cigars in their mouths.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of</para>
  <para>the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The</para>
  <para>photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are</para>
  <para>that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey</para>
  <para>Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his</para>
  <para>princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the</para>
  <para>photograph?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where, indeed?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is</para>
  <para>cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's</para>
  <para>dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid</para>
  <para>and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We</para>
  <para>may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But</para>
  <para>I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,</para>
  <para>and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it</para>
  <para>over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but</para>
  <para>she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be</para>
  <para>brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she</para>
  <para>had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she</para>
  <para>can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But it has twice been burgled."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But how will you look?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will not look."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will get her to show me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But she will refuse."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is</para>
  <para>her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round</para>
  <para>the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which</para>
  <para>rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of</para>
  <para>the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in</para>
  <para>the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another</para>
  <para>loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce</para>
  <para>quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who</para>
  <para>took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,</para>
  <para>who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and</para>
  <para>in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was</para>
  <para>the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who</para>
  <para>struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes</para>
  <para>dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached</para>
  <para>her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood</para>
  <para>running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to</para>
  <para>their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while</para>
  <para>a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle</para>
  <para>without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to</para>
  <para>attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,</para>
  <para>had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her</para>
  <para>superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking</para>
  <para>back into the street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He is dead," cried several voices.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be</para>
  <para>gone before you can get him to hospital."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the</para>
  <para>lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a</para>
  <para>gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable</para>
  <para>sofa. This way, please!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out</para>
  <para>in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings</para>
  <para>from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the</para>
  <para>blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay</para>
  <para>upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with</para>
  <para>compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I</para>
  <para>know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life</para>
  <para>than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was</para>
  <para>conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited</para>
  <para>upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery</para>
  <para>to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted</para>
  <para>to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under</para>
  <para>my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are</para>
  <para>but preventing her from injuring another.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man</para>
  <para>who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the</para>
  <para>window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the</para>
  <para>signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The</para>
  <para>word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of</para>
  <para>spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and</para>
  <para>servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds</para>
  <para>of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I</para>
  <para>caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice</para>
  <para>of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.</para>
  <para>Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner</para>
  <para>of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my</para>
  <para>friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.</para>
  <para>He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we</para>
  <para>had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the</para>
  <para>Edgeware Road.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could</para>
  <para>have been better. It is all right."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have the photograph?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I know where it is."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And how did you find out?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She showed me, as I told you she would."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am still in the dark."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter</para>
  <para>was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the</para>
  <para>street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I guessed as much."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in</para>
  <para>the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand</para>
  <para>to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That also I could fathom."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else</para>
  <para>could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room</para>
  <para>which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was</para>
  <para>determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for</para>
  <para>air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your</para>
  <para>chance."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How did that help you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on</para>
  <para>fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she</para>
  <para>values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have</para>
  <para>more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the</para>
  <para>Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in</para>
  <para>the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;</para>
  <para>an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to</para>
  <para>me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious</para>
  <para>to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.</para>
  <para>The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were</para>
  <para>enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The</para>
  <para>photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the</para>
  <para>right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a</para>
  <para>glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it</para>
  <para>was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed</para>
  <para>from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making</para>
  <para>my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to</para>
  <para>attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had</para>
  <para>come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to</para>
  <para>wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And now?" I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King</para>
  <para>to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be</para>
  <para>shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is</para>
  <para>probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the</para>
  <para>photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain</para>
  <para>it with his own hands."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And when will you call?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall</para>
  <para>have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage</para>
  <para>may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to</para>
  <para>the King without delay."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was</para>
  <para>searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the</para>
  <para>greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had</para>
  <para>hurried by.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the</para>
  <para>dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have</para>
  <para>been."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>III.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our</para>
  <para>toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed</para>
  <para>into the room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by</para>
  <para>either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not yet."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you have hopes?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have hopes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We must have a cab."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, my brougham is waiting."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off</para>
  <para>once more for Briony Lodge.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Married! When?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yesterday."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But to whom?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To an English lawyer named Norton."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But she could not love him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am in hopes that she does."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And why in hopes?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future</para>
  <para>annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your</para>
  <para>Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason</para>
  <para>why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own</para>
  <para>station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a</para>
  <para>moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in</para>
  <para>Serpentine Avenue.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood</para>
  <para>upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped</para>
  <para>from the brougham.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a</para>
  <para>questioning and rather startled gaze.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She</para>
  <para>left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing</para>
  <para>Cross for the Continent."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and</para>
  <para>surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Never to return."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the</para>
  <para>drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was</para>
  <para>scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and</para>
  <para>open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before</para>
  <para>her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small</para>
  <para>sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a</para>
  <para>photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler</para>
  <para>herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to</para>
  <para>"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend</para>
  <para>tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at</para>
  <para>midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You</para>
  <para>took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a</para>
  <para>suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I</para>
  <para>began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had</para>
  <para>been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly</para>
  <para>be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,</para>
  <para>you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became</para>
  <para>suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind</para>
  <para>old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress</para>
  <para>myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage</para>
  <para>of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to</para>
  <para>watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call</para>
  <para>them, and came down just as you departed.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was</para>
  <para>really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock</para>
  <para>Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and</para>
  <para>started for the Temple to see my husband.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by</para>
  <para>so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when</para>
  <para>you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in</para>
  <para>peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may</para>
  <para>do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly</para>
  <para>wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a</para>
  <para>weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might</para>
  <para>take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to</para>
  <para>possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,</para>
  <para/>
  <para>                                      "Very truly yours,</para>
  <para>                                   "IRENE NORTON, née ADLER."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when</para>
  <para>we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick</para>
  <para>and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?</para>
  <para>Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a</para>
  <para>very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am</para>
  <para>sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business</para>
  <para>to a more successful conclusion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be</para>
  <para>more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The</para>
  <para>photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can</para>
  <para>reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from</para>
  <para>his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more</para>
  <para>highly," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have but to name it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This photograph!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The King stared at him in amazement.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the</para>
  <para>matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He</para>
  <para>bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the</para>
  <para>King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his</para>
  <para>chambers.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom</para>
  <para>of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were</para>
  <para>beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the</para>
  <para>cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And</para>
  <para>when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her</para>
  <para>photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the</para>
  <para>autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a</para>
  <para>very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.</para>
  <para>With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when</para>
  <para>Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door</para>
  <para>behind me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear</para>
  <para>Watson," he said cordially.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was afraid that you were engaged."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So I am. Very much so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I can wait in the next room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and</para>
  <para>helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no</para>
  <para>doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of</para>
  <para>greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small</para>
  <para>fat-encircled eyes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and</para>
  <para>putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in</para>
  <para>judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love</para>
  <para>of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum</para>
  <para>routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by</para>
  <para>the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you</para>
  <para>will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own</para>
  <para>little adventures."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I</para>
  <para>observed.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we</para>
  <para>went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary</para>
  <para>Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary</para>
  <para>combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more</para>
  <para>daring than any effort of the imagination."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my</para>
  <para>view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you</para>
  <para>until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to</para>
  <para>be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call</para>
  <para>upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to</para>
  <para>be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some</para>
  <para>time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique</para>
  <para>things are very often connected not with the larger but with the</para>
  <para>smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for</para>
  <para>doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I</para>
  <para>have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present</para>
  <para>case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is</para>
  <para>certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.</para>
  <para>Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to</para>
  <para>recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend</para>
  <para>Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the</para>
  <para>peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every</para>
  <para>possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some</para>
  <para>slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide</para>
  <para>myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my</para>
  <para>memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the</para>
  <para>facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some</para>
  <para>little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the</para>
  <para>inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the</para>
  <para>advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper</para>
  <para>flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and</para>
  <para>endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the</para>
  <para>indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor</para>
  <para>bore every mark of being an average commonplace British</para>
  <para>tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey</para>
  <para>shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,</para>
  <para>unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy</para>
  <para>Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as</para>
  <para>an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a</para>
  <para>wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,</para>
  <para>look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save</para>
  <para>his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and</para>
  <para>discontent upon his features.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook</para>
  <para>his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.</para>
  <para>"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual</para>
  <para>labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has</para>
  <para>been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of</para>
  <para>writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger</para>
  <para>upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.</para>
  <para>Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did</para>
  <para>manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's</para>
  <para>carpenter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger</para>
  <para>than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more</para>
  <para>developed."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,</para>
  <para>especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you</para>
  <para>use an arc-and-compass breastpin."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for</para>
  <para>five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the</para>
  <para>elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, but China?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right</para>
  <para>wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small</para>
  <para>study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature</para>
  <para>of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a</para>
  <para>delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I</para>
  <para>see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter</para>
  <para>becomes even more simple."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I</para>
  <para>thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see</para>
  <para>that there was nothing in it, after all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake</para>
  <para>in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my</para>
  <para>poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I</para>
  <para>am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger</para>
  <para>planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began</para>
  <para>it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I took the paper from him and read as follows:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late</para>
  <para>Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now</para>
  <para>another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a</para>
  <para>salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All</para>
  <para>red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age</para>
  <para>of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at</para>
  <para>eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7</para>
  <para>Pope's Court, Fleet Street."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice</para>
  <para>read over the extraordinary announcement.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when</para>
  <para>in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"</para>
  <para>said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us</para>
  <para>all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this</para>
  <para>advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,</para>
  <para>Doctor, of the paper and the date."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months</para>
  <para>ago."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock</para>
  <para>Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small</para>
  <para>pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a</para>
  <para>very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than</para>
  <para>just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,</para>
  <para>but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but</para>
  <para>that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the</para>
  <para>business."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,</para>
  <para>either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter</para>
  <para>assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better</para>
  <para>himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after</para>
  <para>all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé who</para>
  <para>comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience</para>
  <para>among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is</para>
  <para>not as remarkable as your advertisement."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a</para>
  <para>fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought</para>
  <para>to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar</para>
  <para>like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his</para>
  <para>main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice</para>
  <para>in him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He is still with you, I presume?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple</para>
  <para>cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the</para>
  <para>house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very</para>
  <para>quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads</para>
  <para>and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.</para>
  <para>Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight</para>
  <para>weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Why that?' I asks.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the</para>
  <para>Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who</para>
  <para>gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than</para>
  <para>there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what</para>
  <para>to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's</para>
  <para>a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a</para>
  <para>very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of</para>
  <para>my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting</para>
  <para>my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what</para>
  <para>was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he</para>
  <para>asked with his eyes open.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Never.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one</para>
  <para>of the vacancies.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And what are they worth?' I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,</para>
  <para>and it need not interfere very much with one's other</para>
  <para>occupations.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,</para>
  <para>for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an</para>
  <para>extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Tell me all about it,' said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for</para>
  <para>yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address</para>
  <para>where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,</para>
  <para>the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah</para>
  <para>Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself</para>
  <para>red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;</para>
  <para>so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous</para>
  <para>fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the</para>
  <para>interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of</para>
  <para>that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to</para>
  <para>do.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who</para>
  <para>would apply.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is</para>
  <para>really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had</para>
  <para>started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the</para>
  <para>old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your</para>
  <para>applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but</para>
  <para>real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.</para>
  <para>Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be</para>
  <para>worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a</para>
  <para>few hundred pounds.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,</para>
  <para>that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed</para>
  <para>to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I</para>
  <para>stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent</para>
  <para>Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might</para>
  <para>prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for</para>
  <para>the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to</para>
  <para>have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for</para>
  <para>the address that was given us in the advertisement.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From</para>
  <para>north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in</para>
  <para>his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.</para>
  <para>Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court</para>
  <para>looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought</para>
  <para>there were so many in the whole country as were brought together</para>
  <para>by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they</para>
  <para>were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;</para>
  <para>but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real</para>
  <para>vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I</para>
  <para>would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear</para>
  <para>of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and</para>
  <para>pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up</para>
  <para>to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream</para>
  <para>upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back</para>
  <para>dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found</para>
  <para>ourselves in the office."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked</para>
  <para>Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge</para>
  <para>pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs</para>
  <para>and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that</para>
  <para>was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate</para>
  <para>as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in</para>
  <para>them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem</para>
  <para>to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn</para>
  <para>came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of</para>
  <para>the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he</para>
  <para>might have a private word with us.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is</para>
  <para>willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has</para>
  <para>every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so</para>
  <para>fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and</para>
  <para>gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he</para>
  <para>plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my</para>
  <para>success.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,</para>
  <para>however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'</para>
  <para>With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I</para>
  <para>yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as</para>
  <para>he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we</para>
  <para>have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and</para>
  <para>once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which</para>
  <para>would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the</para>
  <para>window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the</para>
  <para>vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,</para>
  <para>and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there</para>
  <para>was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the</para>
  <para>manager.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of</para>
  <para>the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are</para>
  <para>you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I answered that I had not.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"His face fell immediately.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am</para>
  <para>sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the</para>
  <para>propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their</para>
  <para>maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a</para>
  <para>bachelor.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was</para>
  <para>not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for</para>
  <para>a few minutes he said that it would be all right.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be</para>
  <para>fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a</para>
  <para>head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your</para>
  <para>new duties?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'</para>
  <para>said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding.</para>
  <para>'I should be able to look after that for you.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What would be the hours?' I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Ten to two.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.</para>
  <para>Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just</para>
  <para>before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in</para>
  <para>the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,</para>
  <para>and that he would see to anything that turned up.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Is 4 pounds a week.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And the work?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Is purely nominal.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What do you call purely nominal?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the</para>
  <para>building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole</para>
  <para>position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You</para>
  <para>don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office</para>
  <para>during that time.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'</para>
  <para>said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness</para>
  <para>nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose</para>
  <para>your billet.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And the work?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia Britannica." There is the first</para>
  <para>volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and</para>
  <para>blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be</para>
  <para>ready to-morrow?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Certainly,' I answered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you</para>
  <para>once more on the important position which you have been fortunate</para>
  <para>enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with</para>
  <para>my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased</para>
  <para>at my own good fortune.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in</para>
  <para>low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the</para>
  <para>whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its</para>
  <para>object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past</para>
  <para>belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay</para>
  <para>such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the</para>
  <para>'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to</para>
  <para>cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the</para>
  <para>whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look</para>
  <para>at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a</para>
  <para>quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for</para>
  <para>Pope's Court.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as</para>
  <para>possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross</para>
  <para>was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off</para>
  <para>upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from</para>
  <para>time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he</para>
  <para>bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had</para>
  <para>written, and locked the door of the office after me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the</para>
  <para>manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my</para>
  <para>week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week</para>
  <para>after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I</para>
  <para>left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only</para>
  <para>once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at</para>
  <para>all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an</para>
  <para>instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet</para>
  <para>was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk</para>
  <para>the loss of it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about</para>
  <para>Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and</para>
  <para>hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very</para>
  <para>long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly</para>
  <para>filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole</para>
  <para>business came to an end."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To an end?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as</para>
  <para>usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a</para>
  <para>little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the</para>
  <para>panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet</para>
  <para>of note-paper. It read in this fashion:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>                  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</para>
  <para/>
  <para>                           IS</para>
  <para/>
  <para>                        DISSOLVED.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>                     October 9, 1890.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the</para>
  <para>rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so</para>
  <para>completely overtopped every other consideration that we both</para>
  <para>burst out into a roar of laughter.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our</para>
  <para>client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can</para>
  <para>do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from</para>
  <para>which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for</para>
  <para>the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you</para>
  <para>will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.</para>
  <para>Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the</para>
  <para>door?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called</para>
  <para>at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything</para>
  <para>about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant</para>
  <para>living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me</para>
  <para>what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had</para>
  <para>never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan</para>
  <para>Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What, the red-headed man?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor</para>
  <para>and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new</para>
  <para>premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Where could I find him?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17</para>
  <para>King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was</para>
  <para>a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever</para>
  <para>heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my</para>
  <para>assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say</para>
  <para>that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite</para>
  <para>good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place</para>
  <para>without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough</para>
  <para>to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right</para>
  <para>away to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an</para>
  <para>exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.</para>
  <para>From what you have told me I think that it is possible that</para>
  <para>graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four</para>
  <para>pound a week."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do</para>
  <para>not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary</para>
  <para>league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some</para>
  <para>30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have</para>
  <para>gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have</para>
  <para>lost nothing by them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,</para>
  <para>and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a</para>
  <para>prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it</para>
  <para>cost them two and thirty pounds."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,</para>
  <para>one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who</para>
  <para>first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he</para>
  <para>been with you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"About a month then."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How did he come?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In answer to an advertisement."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Was he the only applicant?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I had a dozen."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why did you pick him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Because he was handy and would come cheap."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At half-wages, in fact."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,</para>
  <para>though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon</para>
  <para>his forehead."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought</para>
  <para>as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are</para>
  <para>pierced for earrings?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he</para>
  <para>was a lad."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still</para>
  <para>with you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a</para>
  <para>morning."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an</para>
  <para>opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is</para>
  <para>Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what</para>
  <para>do you make of it all?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most</para>
  <para>mysterious business."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less</para>
  <para>mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless</para>
  <para>crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is</para>
  <para>the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this</para>
  <para>matter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I</para>
  <para>beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled</para>
  <para>himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his</para>
  <para>hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his</para>
  <para>black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.</para>
  <para>I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and</para>
  <para>indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his</para>
  <para>chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put</para>
  <para>his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he</para>
  <para>remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare</para>
  <para>you for a few hours?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very</para>
  <para>absorbing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City</para>
  <para>first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that</para>
  <para>there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is</para>
  <para>rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is</para>
  <para>introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short</para>
  <para>walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular</para>
  <para>story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,</para>
  <para>little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy</para>
  <para>two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in</para>
  <para>enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded</para>
  <para>laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and</para>
  <para>uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with</para>
  <para>"JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced</para>
  <para>the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side</para>
  <para>and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between</para>
  <para>puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down</para>
  <para>again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally</para>
  <para>he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously</para>
  <para>upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up</para>
  <para>to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a</para>
  <para>bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step</para>
  <para>in.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would</para>
  <para>go from here to the Strand."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly,</para>
  <para>closing the door.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,</para>
  <para>in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring</para>
  <para>I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known</para>
  <para>something of him before."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good</para>
  <para>deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you</para>
  <para>inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The knees of his trousers."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And what did you see?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What I expected to see."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why did you beat the pavement?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We</para>
  <para>are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg</para>
  <para>Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the</para>
  <para>corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a</para>
  <para>contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was</para>
  <para>one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City</para>
  <para>to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense</para>
  <para>stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,</para>
  <para>while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of</para>
  <para>pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line</para>
  <para>of fine shops and stately business premises that they really</para>
  <para>abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square</para>
  <para>which we had just quitted.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing</para>
  <para>along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the</para>
  <para>houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of</para>
  <para>London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little</para>
  <para>newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,</para>
  <para>the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building</para>
  <para>depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,</para>
  <para>Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A</para>
  <para>sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where</para>
  <para>all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no</para>
  <para>red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a</para>
  <para>very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All</para>
  <para>the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect</para>
  <para>happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the</para>
  <para>music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes</para>
  <para>were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the</para>
  <para>relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was</para>
  <para>possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature</para>
  <para>alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and</para>
  <para>astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction</para>
  <para>against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally</para>
  <para>predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from</para>
  <para>extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was</para>
  <para>never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been</para>
  <para>lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his</para>
  <para>black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase</para>
  <para>would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning</para>
  <para>power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were</para>
  <para>unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a</para>
  <para>man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him</para>
  <para>that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I</para>
  <para>felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set</para>
  <para>himself to hunt down.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we</para>
  <para>emerged.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, it would be as well."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This</para>
  <para>business at Coburg Square is serious."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why serious?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to</para>
  <para>believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being</para>
  <para>Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help</para>
  <para>to-night."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At what time?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ten will be early enough."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,</para>
  <para>so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his</para>
  <para>hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the</para>
  <para>crowd.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was</para>
  <para>always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings</para>
  <para>with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had</para>
  <para>seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that</para>
  <para>he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to</para>
  <para>happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and</para>
  <para>grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought</para>
  <para>over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed</para>
  <para>copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg</para>
  <para>Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.</para>
  <para>What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?</para>
  <para>Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from</para>
  <para>Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a</para>
  <para>formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to</para>
  <para>puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside</para>
  <para>until night should bring an explanation.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my</para>
  <para>way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker</para>
  <para>Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered</para>
  <para>the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering</para>
  <para>his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,</para>
  <para>one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police</para>
  <para>agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a</para>
  <para>very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his</para>
  <para>pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.</para>
  <para>"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me</para>
  <para>introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in</para>
  <para>to-night's adventure."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in</para>
  <para>his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for</para>
  <para>starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do</para>
  <para>the running down."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"</para>
  <para>observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said</para>
  <para>the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which</para>
  <para>are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical</para>
  <para>and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It</para>
  <para>is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of</para>
  <para>the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly</para>
  <para>correct than the official force."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the</para>
  <para>stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.</para>
  <para>It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I</para>
  <para>have not had my rubber."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will</para>
  <para>play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and</para>
  <para>that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,</para>
  <para>the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will</para>
  <para>be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a</para>
  <para>young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his</para>
  <para>profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on</para>
  <para>any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John</para>
  <para>Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been</para>
  <para>to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and</para>
  <para>though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to</para>
  <para>find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,</para>
  <para>and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.</para>
  <para>I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him</para>
  <para>yet."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.</para>
  <para>I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I</para>
  <para>agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is</para>
  <para>past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two</para>
  <para>will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the</para>
  <para>second."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive</para>
  <para>and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in</para>
  <para>the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit</para>
  <para>streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow</para>
  <para>Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the</para>
  <para>matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is</para>
  <para>not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.</para>
  <para>He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as</para>
  <para>tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we</para>
  <para>are, and they are waiting for us."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had</para>
  <para>found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,</para>
  <para>following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a</para>
  <para>narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.</para>
  <para>Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive</para>
  <para>iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding</para>
  <para>stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.</para>
  <para>Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us</para>
  <para>down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a</para>
  <para>third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all</para>
  <para>round with crates and massive boxes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he</para>
  <para>held up the lantern and gazed about him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon</para>
  <para>the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite</para>
  <para>hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes</para>
  <para>severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our</para>
  <para>expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit</para>
  <para>down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a</para>
  <para>very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his</para>
  <para>knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,</para>
  <para>began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few</para>
  <para>seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again</para>
  <para>and put his glass in his pocket.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can</para>
  <para>hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.</para>
  <para>Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their</para>
  <para>work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at</para>
  <para>present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of</para>
  <para>the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.</para>
  <para>Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to</para>
  <para>you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of</para>
  <para>London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at</para>
  <para>present."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had</para>
  <para>several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your French gold?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources</para>
  <para>and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of</para>
  <para>France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to</para>
  <para>unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The</para>
  <para>crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between</para>
  <para>layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at</para>
  <para>present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the</para>
  <para>directors have had misgivings upon the subject."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is</para>
  <para>time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an</para>
  <para>hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.</para>
  <para>Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And sit in the dark?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and</para>
  <para>I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your</para>
  <para>rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have</para>
  <para>gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,</para>
  <para>first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,</para>
  <para>and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us</para>
  <para>some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,</para>
  <para>and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a</para>
  <para>light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no</para>
  <para>compunction about shooting them down."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case</para>
  <para>behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front</para>
  <para>of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute</para>
  <para>darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot</para>
  <para>metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready</para>
  <para>to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked</para>
  <para>up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and</para>
  <para>subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the</para>
  <para>vault.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back</para>
  <para>through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have</para>
  <para>done what I asked you, Jones?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent</para>
  <para>and wait."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but</para>
  <para>an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must</para>
  <para>have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs</para>
  <para>were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my</para>
  <para>nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my</para>
  <para>hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle</para>
  <para>breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,</para>
  <para>heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note</para>
  <para>of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case</para>
  <para>in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint</para>
  <para>of a light.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then</para>
  <para>it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,</para>
  <para>without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand</para>
  <para>appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the</para>
  <para>centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the</para>
  <para>hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then</para>
  <para>it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark</para>
  <para>again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between</para>
  <para>the stones.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,</para>
  <para>tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon</para>
  <para>its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed</para>
  <para>the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,</para>
  <para>boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand</para>
  <para>on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and</para>
  <para>waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another</para>
  <para>instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after</para>
  <para>him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face</para>
  <para>and a shock of very red hair.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the</para>
  <para>bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the</para>
  <para>collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of</para>
  <para>rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed</para>
  <para>upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came</para>
  <para>down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone</para>
  <para>floor.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no</para>
  <para>chance at all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy</para>
  <para>that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his</para>
  <para>coat-tails."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I</para>
  <para>must compliment you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new</para>
  <para>and effective."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker</para>
  <para>at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the</para>
  <para>derbies."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"</para>
  <para>remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.</para>
  <para>"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have</para>
  <para>the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and</para>
  <para>'please.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would</para>
  <para>you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry</para>
  <para>your Highness to the police-station?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow</para>
  <para>to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the</para>
  <para>detective.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them</para>
  <para>from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or</para>
  <para>repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated</para>
  <para>in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts</para>
  <para>at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.</para>
  <para>John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over</para>
  <para>this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond</para>
  <para>that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in</para>
  <para>many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of</para>
  <para>the Red-headed League."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning</para>
  <para>as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it</para>
  <para>was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible</para>
  <para>object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of</para>
  <para>the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get</para>
  <para>this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of</para>
  <para>hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,</para>
  <para>really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was</para>
  <para>no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his</para>
  <para>accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw</para>
  <para>him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?</para>
  <para>They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary</para>
  <para>office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and</para>
  <para>together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the</para>
  <para>week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for</para>
  <para>half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive</para>
  <para>for securing the situation."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But how could you guess what the motive was?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a</para>
  <para>mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The</para>
  <para>man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his</para>
  <para>house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and</para>
  <para>such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something</para>
  <para>out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's</para>
  <para>fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the</para>
  <para>cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then</para>
  <para>I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I</para>
  <para>had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in</para>
  <para>London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which</para>
  <para>took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once</para>
  <para>more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel</para>
  <para>to some other building.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I</para>
  <para>surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was</para>
  <para>ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.</para>
  <para>It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the</para>
  <para>assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had</para>
  <para>never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his</para>
  <para>face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have</para>
  <para>remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of</para>
  <para>those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they</para>
  <para>were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and</para>
  <para>Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I</para>
  <para>had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I</para>
  <para>called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank</para>
  <para>directors, with the result that you have seen."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt</para>
  <para>to-night?" I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that</para>
  <para>they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other</para>
  <para>words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential</para>
  <para>that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the</para>
  <para>bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than</para>
  <para>any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.</para>
  <para>For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned</para>
  <para>admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings</para>
  <para>true."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already</para>
  <para>feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort</para>
  <para>to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little</para>
  <para>problems help me to do so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of</para>
  <para>some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre</para>
  <para>c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."</para>

  <para>"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side</para>
  <para>of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely</para>
  <para>stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We</para>
  <para>would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere</para>
  <para>commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window</para>
  <para>hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the</para>
  <para>roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the</para>
  <para>strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the</para>
  <para>wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and</para>
  <para>leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with</para>
  <para>its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and</para>
  <para>unprofitable."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which</para>
  <para>come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and</para>
  <para>vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to</para>
  <para>its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,</para>
  <para>neither fascinating nor artistic."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a</para>
  <para>realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the</para>
  <para>police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the</para>
  <para>platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an</para>
  <para>observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend</para>
  <para>upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking</para>
  <para>so," I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser</para>
  <para>and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout</para>
  <para>three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is</para>
  <para>strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper</para>
  <para>from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the</para>
  <para>first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his</para>
  <para>wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without</para>
  <para>reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of</para>
  <para>course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the</para>
  <para>bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of</para>
  <para>writers could invent nothing more crude."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"</para>
  <para>said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This</para>
  <para>is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged</para>
  <para>in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The</para>
  <para>husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the</para>
  <para>conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of</para>
  <para>winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling</para>
  <para>them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely</para>
  <para>to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a</para>
  <para>pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over</para>
  <para>you in your example."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in</para>
  <para>the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his</para>
  <para>homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon</para>
  <para>it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.</para>
  <para>It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my</para>
  <para>assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which</para>
  <para>sparkled upon his finger.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in</para>
  <para>which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it</para>
  <para>even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of</para>
  <para>my little problems."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of</para>
  <para>interest. They are important, you understand, without being</para>
  <para>interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in</para>
  <para>unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,</para>
  <para>and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the</para>
  <para>charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the</para>
  <para>simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is</para>
  <para>the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter</para>
  <para>which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing</para>
  <para>which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,</para>
  <para>that I may have something better before very many minutes are</para>
  <para>over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted</para>
  <para>blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.</para>
  <para>Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite</para>
  <para>there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,</para>
  <para>and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was</para>
  <para>tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her</para>
  <para>ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,</para>
  <para>hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated</para>
  <para>backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove</para>
  <para>buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves</para>
  <para>the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp</para>
  <para>clang of the bell.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his</para>
  <para>cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always</para>
  <para>means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure</para>
  <para>that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet</para>
  <para>even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously</para>
  <para>wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom</para>
  <para>is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love</para>
  <para>matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or</para>
  <para>grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons</para>
  <para>entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself</para>
  <para>loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed</para>
  <para>merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed</para>
  <para>her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,</para>
  <para>having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked</para>
  <para>her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was</para>
  <para>peculiar to him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a</para>
  <para>little trying to do so much typewriting?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters</para>
  <para>are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport</para>
  <para>of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear</para>
  <para>and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've</para>
  <para>heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know</para>
  <para>all that?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know</para>
  <para>things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others</para>
  <para>overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,</para>
  <para>whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had</para>
  <para>given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as</para>
  <para>much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in</para>
  <para>my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and</para>
  <para>I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to</para>
  <para>the ceiling.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss</para>
  <para>Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,</para>
  <para>"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.</para>
  <para>Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to</para>
  <para>the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he</para>
  <para>would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,</para>
  <para>it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away</para>
  <para>to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the</para>
  <para>name is different."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,</para>
  <para>too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And your mother is alive?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.</para>
  <para>Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and</para>
  <para>a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father</para>
  <para>was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy</para>
  <para>business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the</para>
  <para>foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the</para>
  <para>business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.</para>
  <para>They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't</para>
  <para>near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this</para>
  <para>rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he</para>
  <para>had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the</para>
  <para>business?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle</para>
  <para>Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per</para>
  <para>cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can</para>
  <para>only touch the interest."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so</para>
  <para>large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the</para>
  <para>bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in</para>
  <para>every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely</para>
  <para>upon an income of about 60 pounds."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you</para>
  <para>understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a</para>
  <para>burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while</para>
  <para>I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the</para>
  <para>time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it</para>
  <para>over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I</para>
  <para>earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can</para>
  <para>often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.</para>
  <para>"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as</para>
  <para>freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your</para>
  <para>connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked</para>
  <para>nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the</para>
  <para>gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets</para>
  <para>when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and</para>
  <para>sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He</para>
  <para>never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I</para>
  <para>wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I</para>
  <para>was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to</para>
  <para>prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all</para>
  <para>father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing</para>
  <para>fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much</para>
  <para>as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,</para>
  <para>he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,</para>
  <para>mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it</para>
  <para>was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from</para>
  <para>France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and</para>
  <para>shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying</para>
  <para>anything to a woman, for she would have her way."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a</para>
  <para>gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if</para>
  <para>we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to</para>
  <para>say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father</para>
  <para>came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house</para>
  <para>any more."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He</para>
  <para>wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to</para>
  <para>say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But</para>
  <para>then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to</para>
  <para>begin with, and I had not got mine yet."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see</para>
  <para>you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer</para>
  <para>wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each</para>
  <para>other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he</para>
  <para>used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so</para>
  <para>there was no need for father to know."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that</para>
  <para>we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in</para>
  <para>Leadenhall Street--and--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What office?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where did he live, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He slept on the premises."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you don't know his address?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where did you address your letters, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called</para>
  <para>for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be</para>
  <para>chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,</para>
  <para>so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't</para>
  <para>have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come</para>
  <para>from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the</para>
  <para>machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he</para>
  <para>was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think</para>
  <para>of."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom</para>
  <para>of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.</para>
  <para>Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me</para>
  <para>in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to</para>
  <para>be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his</para>
  <para>voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he</para>
  <para>was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,</para>
  <para>and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always</para>
  <para>well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just</para>
  <para>as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,</para>
  <para>returned to France?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we</para>
  <para>should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest</para>
  <para>and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever</para>
  <para>happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite</para>
  <para>right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.</para>
  <para>Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder</para>
  <para>of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the</para>
  <para>week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to</para>
  <para>mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother</para>
  <para>said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like</para>
  <para>that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as</para>
  <para>he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do</para>
  <para>anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the</para>
  <para>company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on</para>
  <para>the very morning of the wedding."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It missed him, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for</para>
  <para>the Friday. Was it to be in church?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near</para>
  <para>King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.</para>
  <para>Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were</para>
  <para>two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a</para>
  <para>four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the</para>
  <para>street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler</para>
  <para>drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and</para>
  <para>when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one</para>
  <para>there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become</para>
  <para>of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was</para>
  <para>last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything</para>
  <para>since then to throw any light upon what became of him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said</para>
  <para>Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all</para>
  <para>the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to</para>
  <para>be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to</para>
  <para>separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,</para>
  <para>and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed</para>
  <para>strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since</para>
  <para>gives a meaning to it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some</para>
  <para>unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he</para>
  <para>would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw</para>
  <para>happened."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter</para>
  <para>again."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And your father? Did you tell him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had</para>
  <para>happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,</para>
  <para>what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of</para>
  <para>the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my</para>
  <para>money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,</para>
  <para>there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about</para>
  <para>money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what</para>
  <para>could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me</para>
  <para>half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She</para>
  <para>pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob</para>
  <para>heavily into it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and</para>
  <para>I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the</para>
  <para>weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind</para>
  <para>dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel</para>
  <para>vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I fear not."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then what has happened to him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an</para>
  <para>accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can</para>
  <para>spare."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.</para>
  <para>"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. And your address?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your</para>
  <para>father's place of business?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He travels for Westhouse &amp; Marbank, the great claret importers</para>
  <para>of Fenchurch Street."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will</para>
  <para>leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given</para>
  <para>you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it</para>
  <para>to affect your life."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be</para>
  <para>true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was</para>
  <para>something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which</para>
  <para>compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon</para>
  <para>the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever</para>
  <para>she might be summoned.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips</para>
  <para>still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,</para>
  <para>and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down</para>
  <para>from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a</para>
  <para>counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with</para>
  <para>the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of</para>
  <para>infinite languor in his face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found</para>
  <para>her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,</para>
  <para>is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you</para>
  <para>consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of</para>
  <para>the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,</para>
  <para>there were one or two details which were new to me. But the</para>
  <para>maiden herself was most instructive."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite</para>
  <para>invisible to me," I remarked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to</para>
  <para>look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring</para>
  <para>you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of</para>
  <para>thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.</para>
  <para>Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe</para>
  <para>it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a</para>
  <para>feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads</para>
  <para>sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her</para>
  <para>dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little</para>
  <para>purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and</para>
  <para>were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't</para>
  <para>observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a</para>
  <para>general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,</para>
  <para>easy-going way."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have</para>
  <para>really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed</para>
  <para>everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and</para>
  <para>you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general</para>
  <para>impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My</para>
  <para>first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is</para>
  <para>perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you</para>
  <para>observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most</para>
  <para>useful material for showing traces. The double line a little</para>
  <para>above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,</para>
  <para>was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,</para>
  <para>leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side</para>
  <para>of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the</para>
  <para>broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,</para>
  <para>observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I</para>
  <para>ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed</para>
  <para>to surprise her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It surprised me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and</para>
  <para>interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots</para>
  <para>which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were</para>
  <para>really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and</para>
  <para>the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower</para>
  <para>buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and</para>
  <para>fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly</para>
  <para>dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,</para>
  <para>it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by</para>
  <para>my friend's incisive reasoning.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving</para>
  <para>home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right</para>
  <para>glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see</para>
  <para>that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had</para>
  <para>written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been</para>
  <para>this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.</para>
  <para>All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back</para>
  <para>to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised</para>
  <para>description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I held the little printed slip to the light.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman</para>
  <para>named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;</para>
  <para>strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in</para>
  <para>the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted</para>
  <para>glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,</para>
  <para>in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert</para>
  <para>chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over</para>
  <para>elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in</para>
  <para>Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,</para>
  <para>glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no</para>
  <para>clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There</para>
  <para>is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike</para>
  <para>you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They are typewritten," I remarked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the</para>
  <para>neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you</para>
  <para>see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is</para>
  <para>rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in</para>
  <para>fact, we may call it conclusive."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Of what?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it</para>
  <para>bears upon the case?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able</para>
  <para>to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were</para>
  <para>instituted."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,</para>
  <para>which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the</para>
  <para>other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking</para>
  <para>him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow</para>
  <para>evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the</para>
  <para>male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the</para>
  <para>answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem</para>
  <para>upon the shelf for the interim."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers</para>
  <para>of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that</para>
  <para>he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy</para>
  <para>demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had</para>
  <para>been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in</para>
  <para>the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler</para>
  <para>photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the</para>
  <para>Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with</para>
  <para>the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle</para>
  <para>indeed which he could not unravel.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the</para>
  <para>conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would</para>
  <para>find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up</para>
  <para>to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary</para>
  <para>Sutherland.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own</para>
  <para>attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at</para>
  <para>the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six</para>
  <para>o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a</para>
  <para>hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too</para>
  <para>late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin</para>
  <para>form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable</para>
  <para>array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell</para>
  <para>of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the</para>
  <para>chemical work which was so dear to him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.</para>
  <para>There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said</para>
  <para>yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback</para>
  <para>is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss</para>
  <para>Sutherland?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet</para>
  <para>opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the</para>
  <para>passage and a tap at the door.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said</para>
  <para>Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at</para>
  <para>six. Come in!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some</para>
  <para>thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a</para>
  <para>bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and</para>
  <para>penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of</para>
  <para>us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a</para>
  <para>slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that</para>
  <para>this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an</para>
  <para>appointment with me for six o'clock?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not</para>
  <para>quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland</para>
  <para>has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far</para>
  <para>better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite</para>
  <para>against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,</para>
  <para>impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily</para>
  <para>controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I</para>
  <para>did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the</para>
  <para>official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family</para>
  <para>misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless</para>
  <para>expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to</para>
  <para>believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am</para>
  <para>delighted to hear it," he said.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has</para>
  <para>really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless</para>
  <para>they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some</para>
  <para>letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one</para>
  <para>side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that</para>
  <para>in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and</para>
  <para>a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other</para>
  <para>characteristics, but those are the more obvious."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,</para>
  <para>and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing</para>
  <para>keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,</para>
  <para>Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another</para>
  <para>little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its</para>
  <para>relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some</para>
  <para>little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come</para>
  <para>from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not</para>
  <para>only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will</para>
  <para>observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen</para>
  <para>other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I</para>
  <para>cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"</para>
  <para>he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know</para>
  <para>when you have done it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in</para>
  <para>the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips</para>
  <para>and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There</para>
  <para>is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too</para>
  <para>transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that</para>
  <para>it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's</para>
  <para>right! Sit down and let us talk it over."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a</para>
  <para>glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he</para>
  <para>stammered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,</para>
  <para>Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a</para>
  <para>petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the</para>
  <para>course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his</para>
  <para>breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up</para>
  <para>on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands</para>
  <para>in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,</para>
  <para>than to us.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her</para>
  <para>money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the</para>
  <para>daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable</para>
  <para>sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have</para>
  <para>made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.</para>
  <para>The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate</para>
  <para>and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with</para>
  <para>her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would</para>
  <para>not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would</para>
  <para>mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her</para>
  <para>stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of</para>
  <para>keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of</para>
  <para>people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not</para>
  <para>answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and</para>
  <para>finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain</para>
  <para>ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an</para>
  <para>idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the</para>
  <para>connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,</para>
  <para>covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with</para>
  <para>a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice</para>
  <para>into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the</para>
  <para>girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off</para>
  <para>other lovers by making love himself."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never</para>
  <para>thought that she would have been so carried away."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very</para>
  <para>decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that</para>
  <para>her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never</para>
  <para>for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the</para>
  <para>gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the</para>
  <para>loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began</para>
  <para>to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as</para>
  <para>far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There</para>
  <para>were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the</para>
  <para>girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the</para>
  <para>deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys</para>
  <para>to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to</para>
  <para>bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it</para>
  <para>would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and</para>
  <para>prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to</para>
  <para>come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and</para>
  <para>hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening</para>
  <para>on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss</para>
  <para>Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to</para>
  <para>his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not</para>
  <para>listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,</para>
  <para>and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished</para>
  <para>away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a</para>
  <para>four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of</para>
  <para>events, Mr. Windibank!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes</para>
  <para>had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold</para>
  <para>sneer upon his pale face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you</para>
  <para>are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is</para>
  <para>you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing</para>
  <para>actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door</para>
  <para>locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal</para>
  <para>constraint."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking</para>
  <para>and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who</para>
  <para>deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a</para>
  <para>friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"</para>
  <para>he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon</para>
  <para>the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but</para>
  <para>here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat</para>
  <para>myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he</para>
  <para>could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,</para>
  <para>the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.</para>
  <para>James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he</para>
  <para>threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will</para>
  <para>rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and</para>
  <para>ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not</para>
  <para>entirely devoid of interest."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I</para>
  <para>remarked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.</para>
  <para>Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious</para>
  <para>conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really</para>
  <para>profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the</para>
  <para>stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,</para>
  <para>but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was</para>
  <para>suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,</para>
  <para>which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My</para>
  <para>suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in</para>
  <para>typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his</para>
  <para>handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even</para>
  <para>the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,</para>
  <para>together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same</para>
  <para>direction."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And how did you verify them?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I</para>
  <para>knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed</para>
  <para>description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the</para>
  <para>result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I</para>
  <para>sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me</para>
  <para>whether it answered to the description of any of their</para>
  <para>travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the</para>
  <para>typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business</para>
  <para>address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his</para>
  <para>reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but</para>
  <para>characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from</para>
  <para>Westhouse &amp; Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the</para>
  <para>description tallied in every respect with that of their employé,</para>
  <para>James Windibank. Voilà tout!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And Miss Sutherland?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old</para>
  <para>Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger</para>
  <para>cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'</para>
  <para>There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much</para>
  <para>knowledge of the world."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the</para>
  <para>maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran</para>
  <para>in this way:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from</para>
  <para>the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.</para>
  <para>Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.</para>
  <para>Leave Paddington by the 11:15."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.</para>
  <para>"Will you go?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at</para>
  <para>present."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking</para>
  <para>a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,</para>
  <para>and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained</para>
  <para>through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack</para>
  <para>at once, for I have only half an hour."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the</para>
  <para>effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were</para>
  <para>few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a</para>
  <para>cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock</para>
  <para>Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt</para>
  <para>figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey</para>
  <para>travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It</para>
  <para>makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on</para>
  <para>whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless</para>
  <para>or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall</para>
  <para>get the tickets."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of</para>
  <para>papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged</para>
  <para>and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until</para>
  <para>we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a</para>
  <para>gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just</para>
  <para>been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the</para>
  <para>particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those</para>
  <para>simple cases which are so extremely difficult."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That sounds a little paradoxical."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a</para>
  <para>clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more</para>
  <para>difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they</para>
  <para>have established a very serious case against the son of the</para>
  <para>murdered man."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is a murder, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for</para>
  <para>granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into</para>
  <para>it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have</para>
  <para>been able to understand it, in a very few words.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in</para>
  <para>Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a</para>
  <para>Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned</para>
  <para>some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he</para>
  <para>held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was</para>
  <para>also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the</para>
  <para>colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to</para>
  <para>settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.</para>
  <para>Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his</para>
  <para>tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect</para>
  <para>equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,</para>
  <para>a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same</para>
  <para>age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have</para>
  <para>avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to</para>
  <para>have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of</para>
  <para>sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the</para>
  <para>neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.</para>
  <para>Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the</para>
  <para>least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the</para>
  <para>families. Now for the facts.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at</para>
  <para>Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the</para>
  <para>Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out</para>
  <para>of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been</para>
  <para>out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told</para>
  <para>the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of</para>
  <para>importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came</para>
  <para>back alive.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a</para>
  <para>mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One</para>
  <para>was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was</para>
  <para>William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both</para>
  <para>these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The</para>
  <para>game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.</para>
  <para>McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the</para>
  <para>same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the</para>
  <para>father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was</para>
  <para>following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in</para>
  <para>the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,</para>
  <para>the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly</para>
  <para>wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the</para>
  <para>edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of</para>
  <para>the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the</para>
  <para>woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she</para>
  <para>saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.</para>
  <para>McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a</para>
  <para>violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very</para>
  <para>strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his</para>
  <para>hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their</para>
  <para>violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached</para>
  <para>home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near</para>
  <para>Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to</para>
  <para>fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came</para>
  <para>running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead</para>
  <para>in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was</para>
  <para>much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right</para>
  <para>hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On</para>
  <para>following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the</para>
  <para>grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated</para>
  <para>blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as</para>
  <para>might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's</para>
  <para>gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the</para>
  <para>body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly</para>
  <para>arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned</para>
  <para>at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the</para>
  <para>magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next</para>
  <para>Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out</para>
  <para>before the coroner and the police-court."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If</para>
  <para>ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so</para>
  <para>here."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes</para>
  <para>thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing,</para>
  <para>but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it</para>
  <para>pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something</para>
  <para>entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case</para>
  <para>looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very</para>
  <para>possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people</para>
  <para>in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the</para>
  <para>daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his</para>
  <para>innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect</para>
  <para>in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in</para>
  <para>his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the</para>
  <para>case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are</para>
  <para>flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly</para>
  <para>digesting their breakfasts at home."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you</para>
  <para>will find little credit to be gained out of this case."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he</para>
  <para>answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some</para>
  <para>other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to</para>
  <para>Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting</para>
  <para>when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by</para>
  <para>means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of</para>
  <para>understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly</para>
  <para>perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand</para>
  <para>side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted</para>
  <para>even so self-evident a thing as that."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How on earth--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness</para>
  <para>which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this</para>
  <para>season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less</para>
  <para>and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until</para>
  <para>it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the</para>
  <para>jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated</para>
  <para>than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking</para>
  <para>at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a</para>
  <para>result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and</para>
  <para>inference. Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that</para>
  <para>it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before</para>
  <para>us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in</para>
  <para>the inquest, and which are worth considering."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What are they?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after</para>
  <para>the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary</para>
  <para>informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not</para>
  <para>surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.</para>
  <para>This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any</para>
  <para>traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the</para>
  <para>coroner's jury."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was a confession," I ejaculated.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at</para>
  <para>least a most suspicious remark."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I</para>
  <para>can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,</para>
  <para>he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the</para>
  <para>circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared</para>
  <para>surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I</para>
  <para>should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such</para>
  <para>surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,</para>
  <para>and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His</para>
  <para>frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent</para>
  <para>man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and</para>
  <para>firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not</para>
  <para>unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of</para>
  <para>his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day</para>
  <para>so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and</para>
  <para>even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so</para>
  <para>important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The</para>
  <para>self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark</para>
  <para>appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a</para>
  <para>guilty one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter</para>
  <para>evidence," I remarked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,</para>
  <para>though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.</para>
  <para>You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire</para>
  <para>paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the</para>
  <para>paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own</para>
  <para>statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the</para>
  <para>corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this</para>
  <para>way:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called</para>
  <para>and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for</para>
  <para>three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the</para>
  <para>morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at</para>
  <para>the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he</para>
  <para>had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after</para>
  <para>my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,</para>
  <para>looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out</para>
  <para>of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was</para>
  <para>going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of</para>
  <para>the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit</para>
  <para>warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William</para>
  <para>Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but</para>
  <para>he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had</para>
  <para>no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards</para>
  <para>from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal</para>
  <para>between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found</para>
  <para>him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at</para>
  <para>seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A</para>
  <para>conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,</para>
  <para>for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his</para>
  <para>passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned</para>
  <para>towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,</para>
  <para>however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me</para>
  <para>to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,</para>
  <para>with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in</para>
  <para>my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for</para>
  <para>some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,</para>
  <para>his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one</para>
  <para>near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by</para>
  <para>his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and</para>
  <para>forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no</para>
  <para>active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before</para>
  <para>he died?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some</para>
  <para>allusion to a rat.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was</para>
  <para>delirious.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father</para>
  <para>had this final quarrel?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can</para>
  <para>assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which</para>
  <para>followed.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point</para>
  <para>out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case</para>
  <para>considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: I must still refuse.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common</para>
  <para>signal between you and your father?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: It was.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw</para>
  <para>you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions</para>
  <para>when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father</para>
  <para>fatally injured?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: Nothing definite.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Coroner: What do you mean?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into</para>
  <para>the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet</para>
  <para>I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay</para>
  <para>upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be</para>
  <para>something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.</para>
  <para>When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was</para>
  <para>gone.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, it was gone.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You cannot say what it was?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, I had a feeling something was there.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'How far from the body?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'A dozen yards or so.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'About the same.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen</para>
  <para>yards of it?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, but with my back towards it.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This concluded the examination of the witness."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner</para>
  <para>in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.</para>
  <para>He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his</para>
  <para>father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his</para>
  <para>refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and</para>
  <para>his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,</para>
  <para>as he remarks, very much against the son."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon</para>
  <para>the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some</para>
  <para>pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the</para>
  <para>young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him</para>
  <para>credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too</para>
  <para>little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would</para>
  <para>give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from</para>
  <para>his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying</para>
  <para>reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,</para>
  <para>sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what</para>
  <para>this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that</para>
  <para>hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and</para>
  <para>not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the</para>
  <para>scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be</para>
  <para>there in twenty minutes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through</para>
  <para>the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,</para>
  <para>found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A</para>
  <para>lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for</para>
  <para>us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and</para>
  <para>leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic</para>
  <para>surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of</para>
  <para>Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a</para>
  <para>room had already been engaged for us.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup</para>
  <para>of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be</para>
  <para>happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It</para>
  <para>is entirely a question of barometric pressure."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud</para>
  <para>in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need</para>
  <para>smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country</para>
  <para>hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I</para>
  <para>shall use the carriage to-night."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed</para>
  <para>your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as</para>
  <para>plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer</para>
  <para>it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a</para>
  <para>very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your</para>
  <para>opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing</para>
  <para>which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my</para>
  <para>soul! here is her carriage at the door."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the</para>
  <para>most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her</para>
  <para>violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her</para>
  <para>cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her</para>
  <para>overpowering excitement and concern.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the</para>
  <para>other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,</para>
  <para>fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I</para>
  <para>have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.</para>
  <para>I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,</para>
  <para>too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each</para>
  <para>other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no</para>
  <para>one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a</para>
  <para>charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.</para>
  <para>"You may rely upon my doing all that I can."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?</para>
  <para>Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself</para>
  <para>think that he is innocent?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that it is very probable."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking</para>
  <para>defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague</para>
  <para>has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did</para>
  <para>it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the</para>
  <para>reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because</para>
  <para>I was concerned in it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In what way?" asked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had</para>
  <para>many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that</para>
  <para>there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always</para>
  <para>loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young</para>
  <para>and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he</para>
  <para>naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there</para>
  <para>were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a</para>
  <para>union?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in</para>
  <para>favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as</para>
  <para>Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father</para>
  <para>if I call to-morrow?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The doctor?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for</para>
  <para>years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken</para>
  <para>to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his</para>
  <para>nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive</para>
  <para>who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, at the mines."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner</para>
  <para>made his money."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, certainly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to</para>
  <para>me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you</para>
  <para>will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do</para>
  <para>tell him that I know him to be innocent."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will, Miss Turner."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if</para>
  <para>I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She</para>
  <para>hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we</para>
  <para>heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a</para>
  <para>few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you</para>
  <para>are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I</para>
  <para>call it cruel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said</para>
  <para>Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, but only for you and me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have</para>
  <para>still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ample."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very</para>
  <para>slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through</para>
  <para>the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,</para>
  <para>where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a</para>
  <para>yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,</para>
  <para>however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were</para>
  <para>groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the</para>
  <para>action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and</para>
  <para>gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the</para>
  <para>day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were</para>
  <para>absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely</para>
  <para>unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between</para>
  <para>the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,</para>
  <para>drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was</para>
  <para>something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the</para>
  <para>nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?</para>
  <para>I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which</para>
  <para>contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's</para>
  <para>deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left</para>
  <para>parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been</para>
  <para>shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot</para>
  <para>upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from</para>
  <para>behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when</para>
  <para>seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it</para>
  <para>did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his</para>
  <para>back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call</para>
  <para>Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying</para>
  <para>reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be</para>
  <para>delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become</para>
  <para>delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how</para>
  <para>he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my</para>
  <para>brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident</para>
  <para>of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the</para>
  <para>murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his</para>
  <para>overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to</para>
  <para>return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was</para>
  <para>kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a</para>
  <para>tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I</para>
  <para>did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith</para>
  <para>in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long</para>
  <para>as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young</para>
  <para>McCarthy's innocence.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,</para>
  <para>for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.</para>
  <para>"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able</para>
  <para>to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his</para>
  <para>very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not</para>
  <para>wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young</para>
  <para>McCarthy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And what did you learn from him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nothing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Could he throw no light?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew</para>
  <para>who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced</para>
  <para>now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very</para>
  <para>quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,</para>
  <para>sound at heart."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact</para>
  <para>that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as</para>
  <para>this Miss Turner."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,</para>
  <para>insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was</para>
  <para>only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away</para>
  <para>five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get</para>
  <para>into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a</para>
  <para>registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can</para>
  <para>imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not</para>
  <para>doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows</para>
  <para>to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort</para>
  <para>which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,</para>
  <para>at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss</para>
  <para>Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,</para>
  <para>and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would</para>
  <para>have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with</para>
  <para>his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in</para>
  <para>Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that</para>
  <para>point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,</para>
  <para>for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious</para>
  <para>trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and</para>
  <para>has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the</para>
  <para>Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I</para>
  <para>think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all</para>
  <para>that he has suffered."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two</para>
  <para>points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with</para>
  <para>someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his</para>
  <para>son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would</para>
  <para>return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry</para>
  <para>'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the</para>
  <para>crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk</para>
  <para>about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all</para>
  <para>minor matters until to-morrow."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke</para>
  <para>bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with</para>
  <para>the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe</para>
  <para>Pool.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is</para>
  <para>said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is</para>
  <para>despaired of."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life</para>
  <para>abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This</para>
  <para>business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend</para>
  <para>of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I</para>
  <para>have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody</para>
  <para>about here speaks of his kindness to him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this</para>
  <para>McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have</para>
  <para>been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of</para>
  <para>marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,</para>
  <para>heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,</para>
  <para>as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would</para>
  <para>follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself</para>
  <para>was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not</para>
  <para>deduce something from that?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said</para>
  <para>Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts,</para>
  <para>Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard</para>
  <para>to tackle the facts."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it</para>
  <para>difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And that is--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that</para>
  <para>all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,</para>
  <para>laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley</para>
  <para>Farm upon the left."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking</para>
  <para>building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches</para>
  <para>of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless</para>
  <para>chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight</para>
  <para>of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,</para>
  <para>when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her</para>
  <para>master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the</para>
  <para>son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured</para>
  <para>these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes</para>
  <para>desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed</para>
  <para>the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent</para>
  <para>as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of</para>
  <para>Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed</para>
  <para>and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,</para>
  <para>while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.</para>
  <para>His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips</para>
  <para>compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,</para>
  <para>sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal</para>
  <para>lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated</para>
  <para>upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell</para>
  <para>unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,</para>
  <para>impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way</para>
  <para>along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of</para>
  <para>the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is</para>
  <para>all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon</para>
  <para>the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either</para>
  <para>side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and</para>
  <para>once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and</para>
  <para>I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,</para>
  <para>while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the</para>
  <para>conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a</para>
  <para>definite end.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water</para>
  <para>some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the</para>
  <para>Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.</para>
  <para>Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see</para>
  <para>the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich</para>
  <para>landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods</para>
  <para>grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass</para>
  <para>twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds</para>
  <para>which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which</para>
  <para>the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,</para>
  <para>that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the</para>
  <para>fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager</para>
  <para>face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read</para>
  <para>upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking</para>
  <para>up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon</para>
  <para>or other trace. But how on earth--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its</para>
  <para>inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and</para>
  <para>there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all</para>
  <para>have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo</para>
  <para>and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the</para>
  <para>lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or</para>
  <para>eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of</para>
  <para>the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his</para>
  <para>waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to</para>
  <para>himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he</para>
  <para>was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are</para>
  <para>deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his</para>
  <para>story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are</para>
  <para>the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It</para>
  <para>is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?</para>
  <para>Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite</para>
  <para>unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course</para>
  <para>that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up</para>
  <para>and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we</para>
  <para>were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a</para>
  <para>great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced</para>
  <para>his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon</para>
  <para>his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he</para>
  <para>remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,</para>
  <para>gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and</para>
  <para>examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of</para>
  <para>the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among</para>
  <para>the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then</para>
  <para>he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the</para>
  <para>highroad, where all traces were lost.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,</para>
  <para>returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on</para>
  <para>the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a</para>
  <para>word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done</para>
  <para>that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,</para>
  <para>and I shall be with you presently."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove</para>
  <para>back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he</para>
  <para>had picked up in the wood.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.</para>
  <para>"The murder was done with it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see no marks."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There are none."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How do you know, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few</para>
  <para>days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It</para>
  <para>corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other</para>
  <para>weapon."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And the murderer?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears</para>
  <para>thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian</para>
  <para>cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his</para>
  <para>pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be</para>
  <para>enough to aid us in our search."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he</para>
  <para>said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a</para>
  <para>hard-headed British jury."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own</para>
  <para>method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,</para>
  <para>and shall probably return to London by the evening train."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And leave your case unfinished?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, finished."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But the mystery?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is solved."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Who was the criminal, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The gentleman I describe."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But who is he?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a</para>
  <para>populous neighbourhood."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said,</para>
  <para>"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking</para>
  <para>for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the</para>
  <para>laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.</para>
  <para>Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before</para>
  <para>I leave."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where</para>
  <para>we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in</para>
  <para>thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds</para>
  <para>himself in a perplexing position.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit</para>
  <para>down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't</para>
  <para>know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a</para>
  <para>cigar and let me expound."</para>
  <para/>
  <para> "Pray do so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about</para>
  <para>young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,</para>
  <para>although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One</para>
  <para>was the fact that his father should, according to his account,</para>
  <para>cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying</para>
  <para>reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but</para>
  <para>that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double</para>
  <para>point our research must commence, and we will begin it by</para>
  <para>presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The</para>
  <para>son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that</para>
  <para>he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the</para>
  <para>attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But</para>
  <para>'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used</para>
  <para>between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the</para>
  <para>person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was</para>
  <para>someone who had been in Australia."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What of the rat, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened</para>
  <para>it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,"</para>
  <para>he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand</para>
  <para>over part of the map. "What do you read?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"ARAT," I read.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And now?" He raised his hand.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"BALLARAT."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his</para>
  <para>son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter</para>
  <para>the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down</para>
  <para>considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point</para>
  <para>which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a</para>
  <para>certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite</para>
  <para>conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only</para>
  <para>be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could</para>
  <para>hardly wander."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the</para>
  <para>ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that</para>
  <para>imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But how did you gain them?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of</para>
  <para>trifles."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length</para>
  <para>of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, they were peculiar boots."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But his lameness?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than</para>
  <para>his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he</para>
  <para>was lame."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But his left-handedness."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded</para>
  <para>by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from</para>
  <para>immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can</para>
  <para>that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind</para>
  <para>that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had</para>
  <para>even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special</para>
  <para>knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian</para>
  <para>cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and</para>
  <para>written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different</para>
  <para>varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the</para>
  <para>ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss</para>
  <para>where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety</para>
  <para>which are rolled in Rotterdam."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And the cigar-holder?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he</para>
  <para>used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the</para>
  <para>cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which</para>
  <para>he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as</para>
  <para>truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the</para>
  <para>direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of</para>
  <para>our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His</para>
  <para>slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of</para>
  <para>decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and</para>
  <para>his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual</para>
  <para>strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled</para>
  <para>hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air</para>
  <para>of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an</para>
  <para>ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were</para>
  <para>tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that</para>
  <para>he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my</para>
  <para>note?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to</para>
  <para>see me here to avoid scandal."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my</para>
  <para>companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question</para>
  <para>was already answered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It</para>
  <para>is so. I know all about McCarthy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.</para>
  <para>"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you</para>
  <para>my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at</para>
  <para>the Assizes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It</para>
  <para>would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears</para>
  <para>that I am arrested."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It may not come to that," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter</para>
  <para>who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.</para>
  <para>Young McCarthy must be got off, however."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for</para>
  <para>years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a</para>
  <para>month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand</para>
  <para>and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he</para>
  <para>said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson</para>
  <para>here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the</para>
  <para>last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall</para>
  <para>not use it unless it is absolutely needed."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I</para>
  <para>shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I</para>
  <para>should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the</para>
  <para>thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but</para>
  <para>will not take me long to tell.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil</para>
  <para>incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of</para>
  <para>such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,</para>
  <para>and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be</para>
  <para>in his power.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap</para>
  <para>then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at</para>
  <para>anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck</para>
  <para>with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you</para>
  <para>would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and</para>
  <para>we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time</para>
  <para>to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.</para>
  <para>Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party</para>
  <para>is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and</para>
  <para>we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers</para>
  <para>and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of</para>
  <para>their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,</para>
  <para>however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of</para>
  <para>the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the</para>
  <para>Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his</para>
  <para>wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every</para>
  <para>feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made</para>
  <para>our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted</para>
  <para>from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and</para>
  <para>respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in</para>
  <para>the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,</para>
  <para>to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,</para>
  <para>and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.</para>
  <para>Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down</para>
  <para>the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned</para>
  <para>over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was</para>
  <para>going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in</para>
  <para>Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his</para>
  <para>foot.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be</para>
  <para>as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and</para>
  <para>you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,</para>
  <para>law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman</para>
  <para>within hail.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking</para>
  <para>them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land</para>
  <para>ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;</para>
  <para>turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my</para>
  <para>elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more</para>
  <para>afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he</para>
  <para>wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without</para>
  <para>question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing</para>
  <para>which I could not give. He asked for Alice.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was</para>
  <para>known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that</para>
  <para>his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was</para>
  <para>firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that</para>
  <para>I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that</para>
  <para>was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do</para>
  <para>his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses</para>
  <para>to talk it over.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I</para>
  <para>smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.</para>
  <para>But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in</para>
  <para>me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my</para>
  <para>daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she</para>
  <para>were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I</para>
  <para>and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a</para>
  <para>man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and</para>
  <para>a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,</para>
  <para>I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!</para>
  <para>Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I</para>
  <para>did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,</para>
  <para>I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl</para>
  <para>should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more</para>
  <para>than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction</para>
  <para>than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought</para>
  <para>back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I</para>
  <para>was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in</para>
  <para>my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that</para>
  <para>occurred."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man</para>
  <para>signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we</para>
  <para>may never be exposed to such a temptation."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you</para>
  <para>will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the</para>
  <para>Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is</para>
  <para>condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be</para>
  <para>seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or</para>
  <para>dead, shall be safe with us."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,</para>
  <para>when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace</para>
  <para>which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his</para>
  <para>giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate</para>
  <para>play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such</para>
  <para>a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,</para>
  <para>'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a</para>
  <para>number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and</para>
  <para>submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven</para>
  <para>months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is</para>
  <para>every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily</para>
  <para>together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their</para>
  <para>past.</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS</para>
  <para/>
  <para>When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes</para>
  <para>cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which</para>
  <para>present strange and interesting features that it is no easy</para>
  <para>matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,</para>
  <para>have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have</para>
  <para>not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend</para>
  <para>possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of</para>
  <para>these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his</para>
  <para>analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without</para>
  <para>an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and</para>
  <para>have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and</para>
  <para>surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to</para>
  <para>him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable</para>
  <para>in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted</para>
  <para>to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are</para>
  <para>points in connection with it which never have been, and probably</para>
  <para>never will be, entirely cleared up.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater</para>
  <para>or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my</para>
  <para>headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the</para>
  <para>adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant</para>
  <para>Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a</para>
  <para>furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the</para>
  <para>British barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the</para>
  <para>Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the</para>
  <para>Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to</para>
  <para>prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that</para>
  <para>therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a</para>
  <para>deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the</para>
  <para>case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of</para>
  <para>them present such singular features as the strange train of</para>
  <para>circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales</para>
  <para>had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had</para>
  <para>screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that</para>
  <para>even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced</para>
  <para>to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and</para>
  <para>to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which</para>
  <para>shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like</para>
  <para>untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew</para>
  <para>higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in</para>
  <para>the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the</para>
  <para>fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the</para>
  <para>other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until</para>
  <para>the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,</para>
  <para>and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of</para>
  <para>the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a</para>
  <para>few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker</para>
  <para>Street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the</para>
  <para>bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage</para>
  <para>visitors."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A client, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out</para>
  <para>on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more</para>
  <para>likely to be some crony of the landlady's."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there</para>
  <para>came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He</para>
  <para>stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and</para>
  <para>towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Come in!" said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the</para>
  <para>outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of</para>
  <para>refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella</para>
  <para>which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told</para>
  <para>of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about</para>
  <para>him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his</para>
  <para>face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is</para>
  <para>weighed down with some great anxiety.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to</para>
  <para>his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have</para>
  <para>brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug</para>
  <para>chamber."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest</para>
  <para>here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from</para>
  <para>the south-west, I see."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, from Horsham."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is</para>
  <para>quite distinctive."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have come for advice."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is easily got."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And help."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is not always so easy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast</para>
  <para>how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He said that you could solve anything."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He said too much."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That you are never beaten."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a</para>
  <para>woman."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is true that I have been generally successful."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then you may be so with me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me</para>
  <para>with some details as to your case."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is no ordinary one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of</para>
  <para>appeal."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you</para>
  <para>have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of</para>
  <para>events than those which have happened in my own family."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the</para>
  <para>essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards</para>
  <para>question you as to those details which seem to me to be most</para>
  <para>important."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out</para>
  <para>towards the blaze.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,</para>
  <para>as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful</para>
  <para>business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an</para>
  <para>idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the</para>
  <para>affair.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias</para>
  <para>and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,</para>
  <para>which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He</para>
  <para>was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business</para>
  <para>met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire</para>
  <para>upon a handsome competence.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and</para>
  <para>became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done</para>
  <para>very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,</para>
  <para>and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When</para>
  <para>Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where</para>
  <para>he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came</para>
  <para>back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.</para>
  <para>He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his</para>
  <para>reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his</para>
  <para>dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to</para>
  <para>them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very</para>
  <para>foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring</para>
  <para>disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I</para>
  <para>doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or</para>
  <para>three fields round his house, and there he would take his</para>
  <para>exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave</para>
  <para>his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very</para>
  <para>heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any</para>
  <para>friends, not even his own brother.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the</para>
  <para>time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This</para>
  <para>would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years</para>
  <para>in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he</para>
  <para>was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be</para>
  <para>fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would</para>
  <para>make me his representative both with the servants and with the</para>
  <para>tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite</para>
  <para>master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I</para>
  <para>liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in</para>
  <para>his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he</para>
  <para>had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was</para>
  <para>invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or</para>
  <para>anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped</para>
  <para>through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a</para>
  <para>collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such</para>
  <para>a room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp</para>
  <para>lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a</para>
  <para>common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all</para>
  <para>paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From</para>
  <para>India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can</para>
  <para>this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little</para>
  <para>dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to</para>
  <para>laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight</para>
  <para>of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his</para>
  <para>skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he</para>
  <para>still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and</para>
  <para>then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his</para>
  <para>room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope</para>
  <para>and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the</para>
  <para>gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else</para>
  <para>save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his</para>
  <para>overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I</para>
  <para>ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,</para>
  <para>which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small</para>
  <para>brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'</para>
  <para>said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my</para>
  <para>room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to</para>
  <para>step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the</para>
  <para>grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned</para>
  <para>paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I</para>
  <para>glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was</para>
  <para>printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the</para>
  <para>envelope.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave</para>
  <para>my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to</para>
  <para>my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to</para>
  <para>you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you</para>
  <para>cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest</para>
  <para>enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't</para>
  <para>say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper</para>
  <para>where Mr. Fordham shows you.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with</para>
  <para>him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest</para>
  <para>impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every</para>
  <para>way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I</para>
  <para>could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left</para>
  <para>behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed</para>
  <para>and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I</para>
  <para>could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,</para>
  <para>and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his</para>
  <para>time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the</para>
  <para>inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy</para>
  <para>and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a</para>
  <para>revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,</para>
  <para>and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by</para>
  <para>man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would</para>
  <para>rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,</para>
  <para>like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror</para>
  <para>which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen</para>
  <para>his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it</para>
  <para>were new raised from a basin.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to</para>
  <para>abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those</para>
  <para>drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when</para>
  <para>we went to search for him, face downward in a little</para>
  <para>green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There</para>
  <para>was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,</para>
  <para>so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,</para>
  <para>brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced</para>
  <para>from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself</para>
  <para>that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,</para>
  <para>however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and</para>
  <para>of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee,</para>
  <para>one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me</para>
  <para>have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and</para>
  <para>the date of his supposed suicide."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks</para>
  <para>later, upon the night of May 2nd."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. Pray proceed."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my</para>
  <para>request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been</para>
  <para>always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its</para>
  <para>contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a</para>
  <para>paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and</para>
  <para>'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.</para>
  <para>These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had</para>
  <para>been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was</para>
  <para>nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many</para>
  <para>scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in</para>
  <para>America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had</para>
  <para>done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.</para>
  <para>Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern</para>
  <para>states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had</para>
  <para>evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag</para>
  <para>politicians who had been sent down from the North.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at</para>
  <para>Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the</para>
  <para>January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my</para>
  <para>father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the</para>
  <para>breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened</para>
  <para>envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the</para>
  <para>outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what</para>
  <para>he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked</para>
  <para>very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon</para>
  <para>himself.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are</para>
  <para>the very letters. But what is this written above them?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his</para>
  <para>shoulder.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the</para>
  <para>papers must be those that are destroyed.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a</para>
  <para>civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.</para>
  <para>Where does the thing come from?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do</para>
  <para>with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such</para>
  <para>nonsense.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Then let me do so?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such</para>
  <para>nonsense.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate</para>
  <para>man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of</para>
  <para>forebodings.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went</para>
  <para>from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is</para>
  <para>in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad</para>
  <para>that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from</para>
  <para>danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in</para>
  <para>error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram</para>
  <para>from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had</para>
  <para>fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the</para>
  <para>neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I</para>
  <para>hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered</para>
  <para>his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from</para>
  <para>Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,</para>
  <para>and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in</para>
  <para>bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'</para>
  <para>Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I</para>
  <para>was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of</para>
  <para>murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no</para>
  <para>robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.</para>
  <para>And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,</para>
  <para>and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been</para>
  <para>woven round him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me</para>
  <para>why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well</para>
  <para>convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an</para>
  <para>incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as</para>
  <para>pressing in one house as in another.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two</para>
  <para>years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time</para>
  <para>I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that</para>
  <para>this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended</para>
  <para>with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,</para>
  <para>however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in</para>
  <para>which it had come upon my father."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and</para>
  <para>turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried</para>
  <para>orange pips.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is</para>
  <para>London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were</para>
  <para>upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the</para>
  <para>papers on the sundial.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What have you done?" asked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nothing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nothing?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white</para>
  <para>hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor</para>
  <para>rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in</para>
  <para>the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight</para>
  <para>and no precautions can guard against."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are</para>
  <para>lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for</para>
  <para>despair."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have seen the police."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that</para>
  <para>the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all</para>
  <para>practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really</para>
  <para>accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with</para>
  <para>the warnings."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible</para>
  <para>imbecility!" he cried.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in</para>
  <para>the house with me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Has he come with you to-night?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No. His orders were to stay in the house."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Again Holmes raved in the air.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you</para>
  <para>not come at once?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major</para>
  <para>Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to</para>
  <para>you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have</para>
  <para>acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than</para>
  <para>that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which</para>
  <para>might help us?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat</para>
  <para>pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted</para>
  <para>paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"</para>
  <para>said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I</para>
  <para>observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the</para>
  <para>ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet</para>
  <para>upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it</para>
  <para>may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from</para>
  <para>among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond</para>
  <para>the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think</para>
  <para>myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is</para>
  <para>undoubtedly my uncle's."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,</para>
  <para>which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from</para>
  <para>a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the</para>
  <para>following enigmatical notices:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and</para>
  <para>      John Swain, of St. Augustine.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"9th. McCauley cleared.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"10th. John Swain cleared.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it</para>
  <para>to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another</para>
  <para>instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told</para>
  <para>me. You must get home instantly and act."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What shall I do?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must</para>
  <para>put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass</para>
  <para>box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say</para>
  <para>that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that</para>
  <para>this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such</para>
  <para>words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you</para>
  <para>must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do</para>
  <para>you understand?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Entirely."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I</para>
  <para>think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our</para>
  <para>web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first</para>
  <para>consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens</para>
  <para>you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the</para>
  <para>guilty parties."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his</para>
  <para>overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall</para>
  <para>certainly do as you advise."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in</para>
  <para>the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that</para>
  <para>you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you</para>
  <para>go back?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"By train from Waterloo."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that</para>
  <para>you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too</para>
  <para>closely."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am armed."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek</para>
  <para>it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news</para>
  <para>as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every</para>
  <para>particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside</para>
  <para>the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered</para>
  <para>against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come</para>
  <para>to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet</para>
  <para>of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them</para>
  <para>once more.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk</para>
  <para>forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he</para>
  <para>lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue</para>
  <para>smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we</para>
  <para>have had none more fantastic than this."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems</para>
  <para>to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the</para>
  <para>Sholtos."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to</para>
  <para>what these perils are?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue</para>
  <para>this unhappy family?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the</para>
  <para>arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal</para>
  <para>reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a</para>
  <para>single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the</para>
  <para>chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which</para>
  <para>would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole</para>
  <para>animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who</para>
  <para>has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents</para>
  <para>should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both</para>
  <para>before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the</para>
  <para>reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study</para>
  <para>which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the</para>
  <para>aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest</para>
  <para>pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to</para>
  <para>utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this</para>
  <para>in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all</para>
  <para>knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and</para>
  <para>encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so</para>
  <para>impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge</para>
  <para>which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have</para>
  <para>endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one</para>
  <para>occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits</para>
  <para>in a very precise fashion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document.</para>
  <para>Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I</para>
  <para>remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the</para>
  <para>mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry</para>
  <para>eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime</para>
  <para>records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and</para>
  <para>self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the</para>
  <para>main points of my analysis."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as</para>
  <para>I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic</para>
  <para>stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the</para>
  <para>rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he</para>
  <para>can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which</para>
  <para>has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster</para>
  <para>all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the</para>
  <para>'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.</para>
  <para>Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be</para>
  <para>deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong</para>
  <para>presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for</para>
  <para>leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their</para>
  <para>habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for</para>
  <para>the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love</para>
  <para>of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of</para>
  <para>someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis</para>
  <para>that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from</para>
  <para>America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by</para>
  <para>considering the formidable letters which were received by himself</para>
  <para>and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those</para>
  <para>letters?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the</para>
  <para>third from London."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that</para>
  <para>the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was</para>
  <para>on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the</para>
  <para>case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and</para>
  <para>its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.</para>
  <para>Does that suggest anything?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A greater distance to travel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I do not see the point."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man</para>
  <para>or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send</para>
  <para>their singular warning or token before them when starting upon</para>
  <para>their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign</para>
  <para>when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a</para>
  <para>steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.</para>
  <para>But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those</para>
  <para>seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which</para>
  <para>brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the</para>
  <para>writer."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is possible."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly</para>
  <para>urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to</para>
  <para>caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which</para>
  <para>it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one</para>
  <para>comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless</para>
  <para>persecution?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital</para>
  <para>importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think</para>
  <para>that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.</para>
  <para>A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way</para>
  <para>as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in</para>
  <para>it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.</para>
  <para>Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.</para>
  <para>In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an</para>
  <para>individual and becomes the badge of a society."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But of what society?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and</para>
  <para>sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I never have."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it</para>
  <para>is," said he presently:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to</para>
  <para>the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret</para>
  <para>society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the</para>
  <para>Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local</para>
  <para>branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,</para>
  <para>Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was</para>
  <para>used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of</para>
  <para>the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country</para>
  <para>of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually</para>
  <para>preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic</para>
  <para>but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some</para>
  <para>parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this</para>
  <para>the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might</para>
  <para>fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would</para>
  <para>unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and</para>
  <para>unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the</para>
  <para>society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a</para>
  <para>case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with</para>
  <para>impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the</para>
  <para>perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite</para>
  <para>of the efforts of the United States government and of the better</para>
  <para>classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year</para>
  <para>1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have</para>
  <para>been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that</para>
  <para>the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the</para>
  <para>disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may</para>
  <para>well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his</para>
  <para>family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.</para>
  <para>You can understand that this register and diary may implicate</para>
  <para>some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many</para>
  <para>who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then the page we have seen--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent</para>
  <para>the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to</para>
  <para>them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or</para>
  <para>left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a</para>
  <para>sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let</para>
  <para>some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only</para>
  <para>chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have</para>
  <para>told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done</para>
  <para>to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for</para>
  <para>half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable</para>
  <para>ways of our fellow-men."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a</para>
  <para>subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the</para>
  <para>great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came</para>
  <para>down.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I</para>
  <para>foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of</para>
  <para>young Openshaw's."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What steps will you take?" I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.</para>
  <para>I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will not go there first?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the</para>
  <para>maid will bring up your coffee."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and</para>
  <para>glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a</para>
  <para>chill to my heart.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it</para>
  <para>done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy</para>
  <para>Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H</para>
  <para>Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and</para>
  <para>a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and</para>
  <para>stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it</para>
  <para>was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was</para>
  <para>given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was</para>
  <para>eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman</para>
  <para>whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his</para>
  <para>pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.</para>
  <para>It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch</para>
  <para>the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and</para>
  <para>the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge</para>
  <para>of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body</para>
  <para>exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that</para>
  <para>the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,</para>
  <para>which should have the effect of calling the attention of the</para>
  <para>authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and</para>
  <para>shaken than I had ever seen him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty</para>
  <para>feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal</para>
  <para>matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my</para>
  <para>hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that</para>
  <para>I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair</para>
  <para>and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a</para>
  <para>flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and</para>
  <para>unclasping of his long thin hands.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could</para>
  <para>they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the</para>
  <para>direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too</para>
  <para>crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,</para>
  <para>we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To the police?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may</para>
  <para>take the flies, but not before."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in</para>
  <para>the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes</para>
  <para>had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he</para>
  <para>entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,</para>
  <para>and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,</para>
  <para>washing it down with a long draught of water.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are hungry," I remarked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since</para>
  <para>breakfast."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nothing?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And how have you succeeded?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have a clue?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not</para>
  <para>long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish</para>
  <para>trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What do you mean?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he</para>
  <para>squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and</para>
  <para>thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote</para>
  <para>"S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain</para>
  <para>James Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling.</para>
  <para>"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a</para>
  <para>precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How did you trace it, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with</para>
  <para>dates and names.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers</para>
  <para>and files of the old papers, following the future career of every</para>
  <para>vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in</para>
  <para>'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were</para>
  <para>reported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'</para>
  <para>instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported</para>
  <para>as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to</para>
  <para>one of the states of the Union."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Texas, I think."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must</para>
  <para>have an American origin."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque</para>
  <para>'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a</para>
  <para>certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present</para>
  <para>in the port of London."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the</para>
  <para>Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by</para>
  <para>the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired</para>
  <para>to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and</para>
  <para>as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the</para>
  <para>Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What will you do, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I</para>
  <para>learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are</para>
  <para>Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away</para>
  <para>from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has</para>
  <para>been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship</para>
  <para>reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and</para>
  <para>the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these</para>
  <para>three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,</para>
  <para>and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the</para>
  <para>orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as</para>
  <para>resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very</para>
  <para>severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for</para>
  <para>news of the "Lone Star" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We</para>
  <para>did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a</para>
  <para>shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough</para>
  <para>of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is</para>
  <para>all which we shall ever know of the fate of the "Lone Star."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal</para>
  <para>of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to</para>
  <para>opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some</para>
  <para>foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De</para>
  <para>Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had</para>
  <para>drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the</para>
  <para>same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the</para>
  <para>practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many</para>
  <para>years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of</para>
  <para>mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see</para>
  <para>him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point</para>
  <para>pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble</para>
  <para>man.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell,</para>
  <para>about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the</para>
  <para>clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work</para>
  <para>down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps</para>
  <para>upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in</para>
  <para>some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,</para>
  <para>suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms</para>
  <para>about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in</para>
  <para>such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.</para>
  <para>How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when</para>
  <para>you came in."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was</para>
  <para>always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds</para>
  <para>to a light-house.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine</para>
  <para>and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or</para>
  <para>should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about</para>
  <para>Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about</para>
  <para>him!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her</para>
  <para>husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend</para>
  <para>and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words</para>
  <para>as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it</para>
  <para>possible that we could bring him back to her?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late</para>
  <para>he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the</para>
  <para>farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been</para>
  <para>confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and</para>
  <para>shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him</para>
  <para>eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the</para>
  <para>dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the</para>
  <para>effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar</para>
  <para>of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could</para>
  <para>she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and</para>
  <para>pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of</para>
  <para>it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second</para>
  <para>thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical</para>
  <para>adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it</para>
  <para>better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would</para>
  <para>send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the</para>
  <para>address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left</para>
  <para>my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding</para>
  <para>eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at</para>
  <para>the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to</para>
  <para>be.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my</para>
  <para>adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the</para>
  <para>high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east</para>
  <para>of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached</para>
  <para>by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the</para>
  <para>mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.</para>
  <para>Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in</para>
  <para>the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the</para>
  <para>light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch</para>
  <para>and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the</para>
  <para>brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the</para>
  <para>forecastle of an emigrant ship.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying</para>
  <para>in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads</para>
  <para>thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a</para>
  <para>dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black</para>
  <para>shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,</para>
  <para>now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of</para>
  <para>the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to</para>
  <para>themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,</para>
  <para>monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then</para>
  <para>suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own</para>
  <para>thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At</para>
  <para>the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside</para>
  <para>which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old</para>
  <para>man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon</para>
  <para>his knees, staring into the fire.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe</para>
  <para>for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend</para>
  <para>of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and</para>
  <para>peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and</para>
  <para>unkempt, staring out at me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of</para>
  <para>reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what</para>
  <para>o'clock is it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nearly eleven."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Of what day?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Of Friday, June 19th."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What</para>
  <para>d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his</para>
  <para>arms and began to sob in a high treble key.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting</para>
  <para>this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here</para>
  <para>a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll</para>
  <para>go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.</para>
  <para>Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, I have one waiting."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I</para>
  <para>owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of</para>
  <para>sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying</para>
  <para>fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed</para>
  <para>the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my</para>
  <para>skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look</para>
  <para>back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I</para>
  <para>glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my</para>
  <para>side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very</para>
  <para>wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between</para>
  <para>his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his</para>
  <para>fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my</para>
  <para>self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of</para>
  <para>astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him</para>
  <para>but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull</para>
  <para>eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and</para>
  <para>grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He</para>
  <para>made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he</para>
  <para>turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided</para>
  <para>into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you</para>
  <para>would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend</para>
  <para>of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with</para>
  <para>you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have a cab outside."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he</para>
  <para>appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should</para>
  <para>recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to</para>
  <para>say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait</para>
  <para>outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for</para>
  <para>they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with</para>
  <para>such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney</para>
  <para>was once confined in the cab my mission was practically</para>
  <para>accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better</para>
  <para>than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular</para>
  <para>adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a</para>
  <para>few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him</para>
  <para>out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a</para>
  <para>very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,</para>
  <para>and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two</para>
  <para>streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.</para>
  <para>Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and</para>
  <para>burst into a hearty fit of laughter.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added</para>
  <para>opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little</para>
  <para>weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical</para>
  <para>views."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was certainly surprised to find you there."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But not more so than I to find you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I came to find a friend."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And I to find an enemy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"An enemy?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural</para>
  <para>prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable</para>
  <para>inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent</para>
  <para>ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been</para>
  <para>recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an</para>
  <para>hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own</para>
  <para>purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have</para>
  <para>vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that</para>
  <para>building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some</para>
  <para>strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless</para>
  <para>nights."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What! You do not mean bodies?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds</para>
  <para>for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It</para>
  <para>is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that</para>
  <para>Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our</para>
  <para>trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his</para>
  <para>teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a</para>
  <para>similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle</para>
  <para>of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through</para>
  <para>the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from</para>
  <para>its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If I can be of use."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still</para>
  <para>more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The Cedars?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I</para>
  <para>conduct the inquiry."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where is it, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But I am all in the dark."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up</para>
  <para>here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a</para>
  <para>crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her</para>
  <para>head. So long, then!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through</para>
  <para>the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which</para>
  <para>widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad</para>
  <para>balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly</para>
  <para>beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and</para>
  <para>mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of</para>
  <para>the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of</para>
  <para>revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a</para>
  <para>star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of</para>
  <para>the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his</para>
  <para>breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat</para>
  <para>beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which</para>
  <para>seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in</para>
  <para>upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,</para>
  <para>and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban</para>
  <para>villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up</para>
  <para>his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he</para>
  <para>is acting for the best.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes</para>
  <para>you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great</para>
  <para>thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are</para>
  <para>not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear</para>
  <para>little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You forget that I know nothing about it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before</para>
  <para>we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can</para>
  <para>get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I</para>
  <para>can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case</para>
  <para>clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a</para>
  <para>spark where all is dark to me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Proceed, then."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee</para>
  <para>a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have</para>
  <para>plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very</para>
  <para>nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made</para>
  <para>friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter</para>
  <para>of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no</para>
  <para>occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into</para>
  <para>town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon</para>
  <para>Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of</para>
  <para>age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very</para>
  <para>affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know</para>
  <para>him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far</para>
  <para>as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while</para>
  <para>he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and</para>
  <para>Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money</para>
  <para>troubles have been weighing upon his mind.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier</para>
  <para>than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important</para>
  <para>commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy</para>
  <para>home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife</para>
  <para>received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his</para>
  <para>departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable</para>
  <para>value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the</para>
  <para>offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up</para>
  <para>in your London, you will know that the office of the company is</para>
  <para>in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where</para>
  <para>you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for</para>
  <para>the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,</para>
  <para>got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through</para>
  <para>Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me</para>
  <para>so far?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is very clear."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.</para>
  <para>Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,</para>
  <para>as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.</para>
  <para>While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly</para>
  <para>heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her</para>
  <para>husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning</para>
  <para>to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she</para>
  <para>distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly</para>
  <para>agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then</para>
  <para>vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that</para>
  <para>he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.</para>
  <para>One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that</para>
  <para>although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town</para>
  <para>in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the</para>
  <para>steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which</para>
  <para>you found me to-night--and running through the front room she</para>
  <para>attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At</para>
  <para>the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of</para>
  <para>whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who</para>
  <para>acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled</para>
  <para>with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the</para>
  <para>lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of</para>
  <para>constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The</para>
  <para>inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the</para>
  <para>continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to</para>
  <para>the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no</para>
  <para>sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was</para>
  <para>no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,</para>
  <para>it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly</para>
  <para>swore that no one else had been in the front room during the</para>
  <para>afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was</para>
  <para>staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had</para>
  <para>been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box</para>
  <para>which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell</para>
  <para>a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had</para>
  <para>promised to bring home.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple</para>
  <para>showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.</para>
  <para>The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an</para>
  <para>abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a</para>
  <para>sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon</para>
  <para>the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom</para>
  <para>window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered</para>
  <para>at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The</para>
  <para>bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On</para>
  <para>examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,</para>
  <para>and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of</para>
  <para>the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were</para>
  <para>all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of</para>
  <para>his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were</para>
  <para>there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these</para>
  <para>garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.</para>
  <para>Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no</para>
  <para>other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon</para>
  <para>the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by</para>
  <para>swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of</para>
  <para>the tragedy.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately</para>
  <para>implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the</para>
  <para>vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was</para>
  <para>known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few</para>
  <para>seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could</para>
  <para>hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence</para>
  <para>was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no</para>
  <para>knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he</para>
  <para>could not account in any way for the presence of the missing</para>
  <para>gentleman's clothes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who</para>
  <para>lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was</para>
  <para>certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.</para>
  <para>Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which</para>
  <para>is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a</para>
  <para>professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police</para>
  <para>regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some</para>
  <para>little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand</para>
  <para>side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the</para>
  <para>wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,</para>
  <para>cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he</para>
  <para>is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the</para>
  <para>greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I</para>
  <para>have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of</para>
  <para>making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised</para>
  <para>at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His</para>
  <para>appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him</para>
  <para>without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face</para>
  <para>disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has</para>
  <para>turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a</para>
  <para>pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular</para>
  <para>contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid</para>
  <para>the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he</para>
  <para>is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be</para>
  <para>thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now</para>
  <para>learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been</para>
  <para>the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed</para>
  <para>against a man in the prime of life?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in</para>
  <para>other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.</para>
  <para>Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that</para>
  <para>weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional</para>
  <para>strength in the others."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray continue your narrative."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the</para>
  <para>window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her</para>
  <para>presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.</para>
  <para>Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful</para>
  <para>examination of the premises, but without finding anything which</para>
  <para>threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not</para>
  <para>arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes</para>
  <para>during which he might have communicated with his friend the</para>
  <para>Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and</para>
  <para>searched, without anything being found which could incriminate</para>
  <para>him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right</para>
  <para>shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been</para>
  <para>cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from</para>
  <para>there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and</para>
  <para>that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from</para>
  <para>the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.</para>
  <para>Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in</para>
  <para>his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to</para>
  <para>Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband</para>
  <para>at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or</para>
  <para>dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the</para>
  <para>police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in</para>
  <para>the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they</para>
  <para>had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not</para>
  <para>Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And</para>
  <para>what do you think they found in the pockets?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot imagine."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with</para>
  <para>pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It</para>
  <para>was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a</para>
  <para>human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between</para>
  <para>the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the</para>
  <para>weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked</para>
  <para>away into the river."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the</para>
  <para>room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose</para>
  <para>that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the</para>
  <para>window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.</para>
  <para>What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him</para>
  <para>that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize</para>
  <para>the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it</para>
  <para>would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little</para>
  <para>time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried</para>
  <para>to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his</para>
  <para>Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.</para>
  <para>There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret</para>
  <para>hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he</para>
  <para>stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the</para>
  <para>pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and</para>
  <para>would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard</para>
  <para>the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the</para>
  <para>window when the police appeared."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It certainly sounds feasible."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a</para>
  <para>better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the</para>
  <para>station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before</para>
  <para>been anything against him. He had for years been known as a</para>
  <para>professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very</para>
  <para>quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and</para>
  <para>the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was</para>
  <para>doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is</para>
  <para>he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are</para>
  <para>all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot</para>
  <para>recall any case within my experience which looked at the first</para>
  <para>glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of</para>
  <para>events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great</para>
  <para>town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and</para>
  <para>we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.</para>
  <para>Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered</para>
  <para>villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have</para>
  <para>touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in</para>
  <para>Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.</para>
  <para>See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside</para>
  <para>that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have</para>
  <para>little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I</para>
  <para>asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.</para>
  <para>Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and</para>
  <para>you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for</para>
  <para>my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have</para>
  <para>no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its</para>
  <para>own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and</para>
  <para>springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding</para>
  <para>gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door</para>
  <para>flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad</para>
  <para>in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy</para>
  <para>pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure</para>
  <para>outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one</para>
  <para>half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head</para>
  <para>and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing</para>
  <para>question.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two</para>
  <para>of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw</para>
  <para>that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No good news?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No bad?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have</para>
  <para>had a long day."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to</para>
  <para>me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it</para>
  <para>possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this</para>
  <para>investigation."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly.</para>
  <para>"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our</para>
  <para>arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so</para>
  <para>suddenly upon us."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were</para>
  <para>not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of</para>
  <para>any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be</para>
  <para>indeed happy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a</para>
  <para>well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had</para>
  <para>been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two</para>
  <para>plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain</para>
  <para>answer."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly, madam."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given</para>
  <para>to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Upon what point?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.</para>
  <para>"Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking</para>
  <para>keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You think that he is dead?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I do."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Murdered?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I don't say that. Perhaps."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And on what day did he meet his death?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On Monday."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how</para>
  <para>it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been</para>
  <para>galvanised.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What!" he roared.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of</para>
  <para>paper in the air.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"May I see it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out</para>
  <para>upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I</para>
  <para>had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The</para>
  <para>envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend</para>
  <para>postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day</para>
  <para>before, for it was considerably after midnight.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your</para>
  <para>husband's writing, madam."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, but the enclosure is."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go</para>
  <para>and inquire as to the address."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How can you tell that?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried</para>
  <para>itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that</para>
  <para>blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight</para>
  <para>off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This</para>
  <para>man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before</para>
  <para>he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not</para>
  <para>familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is</para>
  <para>nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!</para>
  <para>there has been an enclosure here!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One of his hands."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual</para>
  <para>writing, and yet I know it well."</para>
  <para/>

  <para>chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's</para>
  <para>hand, madam?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None. Neville wrote those words."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,</para>
  <para>the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the</para>
  <para>danger is over."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.</para>
  <para>The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from</para>
  <para>him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only</para>
  <para>posted to-day."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is possible."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If so, much may have happened between."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is</para>
  <para>well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I</para>
  <para>should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him</para>
  <para>last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room</para>
  <para>rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that</para>
  <para>something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such</para>
  <para>a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman</para>
  <para>may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical</para>
  <para>reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong</para>
  <para>piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband</para>
  <para>is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away</para>
  <para>from you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very much so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Was the window open?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then he might have called to you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He might."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A call for help, you thought?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. He waved his hands."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the</para>
  <para>unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is possible."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you thought he was pulled back?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He disappeared so suddenly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the</para>
  <para>room?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and</para>
  <para>the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his</para>
  <para>ordinary clothes on?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare</para>
  <para>throat."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Never."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Never."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about</para>
  <para>which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little</para>
  <para>supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day</para>
  <para>to-morrow."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our</para>
  <para>disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary</para>
  <para>after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,</para>
  <para>who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for</para>
  <para>days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,</para>
  <para>rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view</para>
  <para>until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his</para>
  <para>data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now</para>
  <para>preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and</para>
  <para>waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered</para>
  <para>about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from</para>
  <para>the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of</para>
  <para>Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with</para>
  <para>an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front</para>
  <para>of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an</para>
  <para>old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the</para>
  <para>corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,</para>
  <para>silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set</para>
  <para>aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he</para>
  <para>sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found</para>
  <para>the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still</para>
  <para>between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was</para>
  <para>full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of</para>
  <para>shag which I had seen upon the previous night.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Awake, Watson?" he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Game for a morning drive?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the</para>
  <para>stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He</para>
  <para>chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed</para>
  <para>a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one</para>
  <para>was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly</para>
  <para>finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was</para>
  <para>putting in the horse.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his</para>
  <para>boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the</para>
  <para>presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve</para>
  <para>to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the</para>
  <para>key of the affair now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he</para>
  <para>continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been</para>
  <para>there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this</para>
  <para>Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will</para>
  <para>not fit the lock."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into</para>
  <para>the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and</para>
  <para>trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both</para>
  <para>sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country</para>
  <para>carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but</para>
  <para>the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as</para>
  <para>some city in a dream.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,</para>
  <para>flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been</para>
  <para>as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than</para>
  <para>never to learn it at all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily</para>
  <para>from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey</para>
  <para>side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the</para>
  <para>river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the</para>
  <para>right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well</para>
  <para>known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted</para>
  <para>him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come</para>
  <para>down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged</para>
  <para>jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."</para>
  <para>"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small,</para>
  <para>office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a</para>
  <para>telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his</para>
  <para>desk.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged</para>
  <para>with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.</para>
  <para>Clair, of Lee."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So I heard. You have him here?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In the cells."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is he quiet?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Dirty?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his</para>
  <para>face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been</para>
  <para>settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you</para>
  <para>saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I should like to see him very much."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave</para>
  <para>your bag."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I think that I'll take it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a</para>
  <para>passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and</para>
  <para>brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each</para>
  <para>side.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it</para>
  <para>is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door</para>
  <para>and glanced through.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his</para>
  <para>face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and</para>
  <para>heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his</para>
  <para>calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his</para>
  <para>tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely</para>
  <para>dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its</para>
  <para>repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right</para>
  <para>across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up</para>
  <para>one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a</para>
  <para>perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over</para>
  <para>his eyes and forehead.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that</para>
  <para>he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me."</para>
  <para>He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my</para>
  <para>astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very</para>
  <para>quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable</para>
  <para>figure."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't</para>
  <para>look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his</para>
  <para>key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The</para>
  <para>sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep</para>
  <para>slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,</para>
  <para>and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the</para>
  <para>prisoner's face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of</para>
  <para>Lee, in the county of Kent."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled</para>
  <para>off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the</para>
  <para>coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had</para>
  <para>seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the</para>
  <para>repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled</para>
  <para>red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,</para>
  <para>sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,</para>
  <para>rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.</para>
  <para>Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and</para>
  <para>threw himself down with his face to the pillow.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing</para>
  <para>man. I know him from the photograph."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons</para>
  <para>himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I</para>
  <para>charged with?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be</para>
  <para>charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of</para>
  <para>it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been</para>
  <para>twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime</para>
  <para>has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally</para>
  <para>detained."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said</para>
  <para>Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted your wife."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.</para>
  <para>"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My</para>
  <para>God! What an exposure! What can I do?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him</para>
  <para>kindly on the shoulder.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said</para>
  <para>he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,</para>
  <para>if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible</para>
  <para>case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the</para>
  <para>details should find their way into the papers. Inspector</para>
  <para>Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you</para>
  <para>might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case</para>
  <para>would then never go into court at all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have</para>
  <para>endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left</para>
  <para>my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a</para>
  <para>schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent</para>
  <para>education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and</para>
  <para>finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day</para>
  <para>my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the</para>
  <para>metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point</para>
  <para>from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying</para>
  <para>begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to</para>
  <para>base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the</para>
  <para>secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for</para>
  <para>my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my</para>
  <para>face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good</para>
  <para>scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a</para>
  <para>small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of</para>
  <para>hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business</para>
  <para>part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a</para>
  <para>beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned</para>
  <para>home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no</para>
  <para>less than 26s. 4d.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,</para>
  <para>some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ</para>
  <para>served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get</para>
  <para>the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's</para>
  <para>grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,</para>
  <para>and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In</para>
  <para>ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous</para>
  <para>work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in</para>
  <para>a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on</para>
  <para>the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my</para>
  <para>pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up</para>
  <para>reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first</para>
  <para>chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets</para>
  <para>with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a</para>
  <para>low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could</para>
  <para>every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings</para>
  <para>transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,</para>
  <para>a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that</para>
  <para>my secret was safe in his possession.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of</para>
  <para>money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London</para>
  <para>could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average</para>
  <para>takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making</para>
  <para>up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by</para>
  <para>practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.</para>
  <para>All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,</para>
  <para>and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the</para>
  <para>country, and eventually married, without anyone having a</para>
  <para>suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had</para>
  <para>business in the City. She little knew what.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my</para>
  <para>room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,</para>
  <para>to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the</para>
  <para>street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of</para>
  <para>surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my</para>
  <para>confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from</para>
  <para>coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that</para>
  <para>she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on</para>
  <para>those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's</para>
  <para>eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it</para>
  <para>occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that</para>
  <para>the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening</para>
  <para>by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in</para>
  <para>the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was</para>
  <para>weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from</para>
  <para>the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of</para>
  <para>the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes</para>
  <para>would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of</para>
  <para>constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,</para>
  <para>I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.</para>
  <para>Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I</para>
  <para>was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and</para>
  <para>hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would</para>
  <para>be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the</para>
  <para>Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together</para>
  <para>with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to</para>
  <para>fear."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,</para>
  <para>"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to</para>
  <para>post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor</para>
  <para>customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt</para>
  <para>of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are</para>
  <para>to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps</para>
  <para>may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.</para>
  <para>I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for</para>
  <para>having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your</para>
  <para>results."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five</para>
  <para>pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if</para>
  <para>we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second</para>
  <para>morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the</para>
  <para>compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a</para>
  <para>purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the</para>
  <para>right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly</para>
  <para>studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and</para>
  <para>on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable</para>
  <para>hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several</para>
  <para>places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair</para>
  <para>suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the</para>
  <para>purpose of examination.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss</para>
  <para>my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his</para>
  <para>thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in</para>
  <para>connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and</para>
  <para>even of instruction."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his</para>
  <para>crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows</para>
  <para>were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that,</para>
  <para>homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to</para>
  <para>it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of</para>
  <para>some mystery and the punishment of some crime."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of</para>
  <para>those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have</para>
  <para>four million human beings all jostling each other within the</para>
  <para>space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so</para>
  <para>dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events</para>
  <para>may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be</para>
  <para>presented which may be striking and bizarre without being</para>
  <para>criminal. We have already had experience of such."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I</para>
  <para>have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any</para>
  <para>legal crime."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler</para>
  <para>papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the</para>
  <para>adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt</para>
  <para>that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.</para>
  <para>You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is to him that this trophy belongs."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is his hat."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will</para>
  <para>look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual</para>
  <para>problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon</para>
  <para>Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I</para>
  <para>have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's</para>
  <para>fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas</para>
  <para>morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was</para>
  <para>returning from some small jollification and was making his way</para>
  <para>homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in</para>
  <para>the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and</para>
  <para>carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the</para>
  <para>corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger</para>
  <para>and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the</para>
  <para>man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,</para>
  <para>swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.</para>
  <para>Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his</para>
  <para>assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and</para>
  <para>seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,</para>
  <para>dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the</para>
  <para>labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham</para>
  <para>Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of</para>
  <para>Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of</para>
  <para>battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this</para>
  <para>battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Which surely he restored to their owner?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For</para>
  <para>Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to</para>
  <para>the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.</para>
  <para>B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are</para>
  <para>some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in</para>
  <para>this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any</para>
  <para>one of them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What, then, did Peterson do?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,</para>
  <para>knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.</para>
  <para>The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs</para>
  <para>that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it</para>
  <para>should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried</para>
  <para>it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,</para>
  <para>while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who</para>
  <para>lost his Christmas dinner."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Did he not advertise?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Only as much as we can deduce."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"From his hat?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered</para>
  <para>felt?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather</para>
  <para>yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this</para>
  <para>article?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather</para>
  <para>ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round</para>
  <para>shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of</para>
  <para>red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's</para>
  <para>name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were</para>
  <para>scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a</para>
  <para>hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was</para>
  <para>cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,</para>
  <para>although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the</para>
  <para>discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,</para>
  <para>however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in</para>
  <para>drawing your inferences."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective</para>
  <para>fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less</para>
  <para>suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there</para>
  <para>are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others</para>
  <para>which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That</para>
  <para>the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the</para>
  <para>face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the</para>
  <para>last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He</para>
  <para>had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a</para>
  <para>moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his</para>
  <para>fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,</para>
  <para>at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that</para>
  <para>his wife has ceased to love him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear Holmes!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he</para>
  <para>continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a</para>
  <para>sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is</para>
  <para>middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the</para>
  <para>last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are</para>
  <para>the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,</para>
  <para>by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid</para>
  <para>on in his house."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are certainly joking, Holmes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you</para>
  <para>these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I</para>
  <para>am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that</para>
  <para>this man was intellectual?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right</para>
  <para>over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is</para>
  <para>a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a</para>
  <para>brain must have something in it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The decline of his fortunes, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge</para>
  <para>came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the</para>
  <para>band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could</para>
  <para>afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no</para>
  <para>hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the</para>
  <para>foresight and the moral retrogression?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting</para>
  <para>his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.</para>
  <para>"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a</para>
  <para>sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his</para>
  <para>way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see</para>
  <para>that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace</para>
  <para>it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,</para>
  <para>which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other</para>
  <para>hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the</para>
  <para>felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not</para>
  <para>entirely lost his self-respect."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is</para>
  <para>grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses</para>
  <para>lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the</para>
  <para>lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of</para>
  <para>hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all</para>
  <para>appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of</para>
  <para>lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey</para>
  <para>dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,</para>
  <para>showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while</para>
  <para>the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the</para>
  <para>wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in</para>
  <para>the best of training."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear</para>
  <para>Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and</para>
  <para>when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear</para>
  <para>that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's</para>
  <para>affection."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But he might be a bachelor."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his</para>
  <para>wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce</para>
  <para>that the gas is not laid on in his house?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I</para>
  <para>see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt</para>
  <para>that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with</para>
  <para>burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in</para>
  <para>one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never</para>
  <para>got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as</para>
  <para>you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm</para>
  <para>done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a</para>
  <para>waste of energy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew</para>
  <para>open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment</para>
  <para>with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with</para>
  <para>astonishment.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off</para>
  <para>through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon</para>
  <para>the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out</para>
  <para>his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly</para>
  <para>scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but</para>
  <para>of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric</para>
  <para>point in the dark hollow of his hand.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said</para>
  <para>he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you</para>
  <para>have got?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though</para>
  <para>it were putty."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I</para>
  <para>have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day</para>
  <para>lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be</para>
  <para>conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly</para>
  <para>not within a twentieth part of the market price."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire</para>
  <para>plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are</para>
  <para>sentimental considerations in the background which would induce</para>
  <para>the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but</para>
  <para>recover the gem."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I</para>
  <para>remarked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,</para>
  <para>a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's</para>
  <para>jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case</para>
  <para>has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the</para>
  <para>matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers,</para>
  <para>glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,</para>
  <para>doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was</para>
  <para>brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,</para>
  <para>abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the</para>
  <para>valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,</para>
  <para>upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect</para>
  <para>that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess</para>
  <para>of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might</para>
  <para>solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had</para>
  <para>remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been</para>
  <para>called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,</para>
  <para>that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco</para>
  <para>casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was</para>
  <para>accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the</para>
  <para>dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was</para>
  <para>arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found</para>
  <para>either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to</para>
  <para>the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on</para>
  <para>discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,</para>
  <para>where she found matters as described by the last witness.</para>
  <para>Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest</para>
  <para>of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence</para>
  <para>in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for</para>
  <para>robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate</para>
  <para>refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to</para>
  <para>the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion</para>
  <para>during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was</para>
  <para>carried out of court."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully,</para>
  <para>tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the</para>
  <para>sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to</para>
  <para>the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You</para>
  <para>see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much</para>
  <para>more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the</para>
  <para>stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry</para>
  <para>Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other</para>
  <para>characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set</para>
  <para>ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and</para>
  <para>ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To</para>
  <para>do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie</para>
  <para>undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If</para>
  <para>this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What will you say?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at</para>
  <para>the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.</para>
  <para>Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at</para>
  <para>221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very. But will he see it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor</para>
  <para>man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his</para>
  <para>mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson</para>
  <para>that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must</para>
  <para>have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his</para>
  <para>bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to</para>
  <para>see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to</para>
  <para>it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency</para>
  <para>and have this put in the evening papers."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In which, sir?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,</para>
  <para>Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very well, sir. And this stone?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,</para>
  <para>Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here</para>
  <para>with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place</para>
  <para>of the one which your family is now devouring."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and</para>
  <para>held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just</para>
  <para>see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and</para>
  <para>focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet</para>
  <para>baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a</para>
  <para>bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found</para>
  <para>in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable</para>
  <para>in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is</para>
  <para>blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has</para>
  <para>already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a</para>
  <para>vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about</para>
  <para>for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.</para>
  <para>Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the</para>
  <para>gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and</para>
  <para>drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot tell."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had</para>
  <para>anything to do with the matter?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an</para>
  <para>absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he</para>
  <para>was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made</para>
  <para>of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple</para>
  <para>test if we have an answer to our advertisement."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you can do nothing until then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nothing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall</para>
  <para>come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I</para>
  <para>should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I</para>
  <para>believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I</para>
  <para>ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past</para>
  <para>six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I</para>
  <para>approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a</para>
  <para>coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the</para>
  <para>bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I</para>
  <para>arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to</para>
  <para>Holmes' room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair</para>
  <para>and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he</para>
  <para>could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.</para>
  <para>Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is</para>
  <para>more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have</para>
  <para>just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a</para>
  <para>broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of</para>
  <para>grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight</para>
  <para>tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his</para>
  <para>habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in</para>
  <para>front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded</para>
  <para>from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a</para>
  <para>slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the</para>
  <para>impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had</para>
  <para>ill-usage at the hands of fortune.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,</para>
  <para>"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your</para>
  <para>address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not</para>
  <para>been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had</para>
  <para>no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off</para>
  <para>both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a</para>
  <para>hopeless attempt at recovering them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to</para>
  <para>eat it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his</para>
  <para>excitement.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.</para>
  <para>But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is</para>
  <para>about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your</para>
  <para>purpose equally well?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of</para>
  <para>relief.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of</para>
  <para>your own bird, so if you wish--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as</para>
  <para>relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly</para>
  <para>see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are</para>
  <para>going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I</para>
  <para>will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive</para>
  <para>upon the sideboard."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug</para>
  <para>of his shoulders.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the</para>
  <para>way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one</para>
  <para>from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a</para>
  <para>better grown goose."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly</para>
  <para>gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who</para>
  <para>frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in</para>
  <para>the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our</para>
  <para>good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,</para>
  <para>on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to</para>
  <para>receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the</para>
  <para>rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a</para>
  <para>Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With</para>
  <para>a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and</para>
  <para>strode off upon his way.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the</para>
  <para>door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing</para>
  <para>whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not particularly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow</para>
  <para>up this clue while it is still hot."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"By all means."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped</para>
  <para>cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly</para>
  <para>in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out</para>
  <para>into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out</para>
  <para>crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,</para>
  <para>Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into</para>
  <para>Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at</para>
  <para>the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one</para>
  <para>of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open</para>
  <para>the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from</para>
  <para>the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,"</para>
  <para>said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,</para>
  <para>who was a member of your goose club."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed! Whose, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Breckinridge is his name."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,</para>
  <para>and prosperity to your house. Good-night."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat</para>
  <para>as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though</para>
  <para>we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we</para>
  <para>have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal</para>
  <para>servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible</para>
  <para>that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we</para>
  <para>have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,</para>
  <para>and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us</para>
  <para>follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and</para>
  <para>quick march!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a</para>
  <para>zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest</para>
  <para>stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor</para>
  <para>a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was</para>
  <para>helping a boy to put up the shutters.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my</para>
  <para>companion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the</para>
  <para>bare slabs of marble.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That's no good."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, but I was recommended to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Who by?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The landlord of the Alpha."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the</para>
  <para>salesman.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms</para>
  <para>akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the</para>
  <para>geese which you supplied to the Alpha."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you</para>
  <para>should be so warm over such a trifle."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.</para>
  <para>When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end</para>
  <para>of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you</para>
  <para>sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One</para>
  <para>would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the</para>
  <para>fuss that is made over them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been</para>
  <para>making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us</para>
  <para>the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my</para>
  <para>opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the</para>
  <para>bird I ate is country bred."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped</para>
  <para>the salesman.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's nothing of the kind."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I say it is."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I don't believe it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled</para>
  <para>them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that</para>
  <para>went to the Alpha were town bred."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You'll never persuade me to believe that."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Will you bet, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But</para>
  <para>I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be</para>
  <para>obstinate."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said</para>
  <para>he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great</para>
  <para>greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging</para>
  <para>lamp.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I</para>
  <para>was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is</para>
  <para>still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,</para>
  <para>then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers</para>
  <para>after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.</para>
  <para>Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a</para>
  <para>list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just</para>
  <para>read it out to me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs.</para>
  <para>Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, then, what's the last entry?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What have you to say now?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from</para>
  <para>his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the</para>
  <para>air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off</para>
  <para>he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless</para>
  <para>fashion which was peculiar to him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'</para>
  <para>protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,"</para>
  <para>said he. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of</para>
  <para>him, that man would not have given me such complete information</para>
  <para>as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a</para>
  <para>wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our</para>
  <para>quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is</para>
  <para>whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or</para>
  <para>whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what</para>
  <para>that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves</para>
  <para>who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke</para>
  <para>out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a</para>
  <para>little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of</para>
  <para>yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while</para>
  <para>Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was</para>
  <para>shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you</para>
  <para>were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more</para>
  <para>with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.</para>
  <para>Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with</para>
  <para>it? Did I buy the geese off you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little</para>
  <para>man.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She told me to ask you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had</para>
  <para>enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and</para>
  <para>the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes.</para>
  <para>"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this</para>
  <para>fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who</para>
  <para>lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook</para>
  <para>the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang</para>
  <para>round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of</para>
  <para>colour had been driven from his face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering</para>
  <para>voice.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help</para>
  <para>overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.</para>
  <para>I think that I could be of assistance to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other</para>
  <para>people don't know."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you can know nothing of this?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to</para>
  <para>trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton</para>
  <para>Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.</para>
  <para>Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.</para>
  <para>Henry Baker is a member."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried</para>
  <para>the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.</para>
  <para>"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that</para>
  <para>case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this</para>
  <para>wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we</para>
  <para>go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he</para>
  <para>answered with a sidelong glance.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always</para>
  <para>awkward doing business with an alias."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"</para>
  <para>said he, "my real name is James Ryder."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray</para>
  <para>step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you</para>
  <para>everything which you would wish to know."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with</para>
  <para>half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure</para>
  <para>whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.</para>
  <para>Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in</para>
  <para>the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during</para>
  <para>our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and</para>
  <para>the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous</para>
  <para>tension within him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.</para>
  <para>"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,</para>
  <para>Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my</para>
  <para>slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!</para>
  <para>You want to know what became of those geese?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in</para>
  <para>which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the</para>
  <para>tail."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell</para>
  <para>me where it went to?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It came here."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Here?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that</para>
  <para>you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was</para>
  <para>dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.</para>
  <para>I have it here in my museum."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece</para>
  <para>with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up</para>
  <para>the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,</para>
  <para>brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a</para>
  <para>drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or</para>
  <para>you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,</para>
  <para>Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with</para>
  <para>impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little</para>
  <para>more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy</para>
  <para>brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring</para>
  <para>with frightened eyes at his accuser.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I</para>
  <para>could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.</para>
  <para>Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case</para>
  <para>complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the</para>
  <para>Countess of Morcar's?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a</para>
  <para>crackling voice.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of</para>
  <para>sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has</para>
  <para>been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous</para>
  <para>in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the</para>
  <para>making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man</para>
  <para>Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter</para>
  <para>before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.</para>
  <para>What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's</para>
  <para>room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he</para>
  <para>should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled</para>
  <para>the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man</para>
  <para>arrested. You then--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my</para>
  <para>companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.</para>
  <para>"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I</para>
  <para>never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll</para>
  <para>swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's</para>
  <para>sake, don't!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well</para>
  <para>to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this</para>
  <para>poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the</para>
  <para>charge against him will break down."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account</para>
  <para>of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came</para>
  <para>the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies</para>
  <para>your only hope of safety."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you</para>
  <para>it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been</para>
  <para>arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get</para>
  <para>away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment</para>
  <para>the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my</para>
  <para>room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.</para>
  <para>I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's</para>
  <para>house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton</para>
  <para>Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there</para>
  <para>every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;</para>
  <para>and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down</para>
  <para>my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me</para>
  <para>what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I</para>
  <para>had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went</para>
  <para>into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would</para>
  <para>be best to do.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and</para>
  <para>has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met</para>
  <para>me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they</para>
  <para>could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to</para>
  <para>me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind</para>
  <para>to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my</para>
  <para>confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.</para>
  <para>But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had</para>
  <para>gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be</para>
  <para>seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat</para>
  <para>pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at</para>
  <para>the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly</para>
  <para>an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the</para>
  <para>best detective that ever lived.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the</para>
  <para>pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she</para>
  <para>was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in</para>
  <para>it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in</para>
  <para>the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big</para>
  <para>one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill</para>
  <para>open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger</para>
  <para>could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass</para>
  <para>along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped</para>
  <para>and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the</para>
  <para>matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and</para>
  <para>fluttered off among the others.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I</para>
  <para>was feeling which was the fattest.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we</para>
  <para>call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six</para>
  <para>of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen</para>
  <para>for the market.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,</para>
  <para>I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we</para>
  <para>fattened it expressly for you.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it</para>
  <para>you want, then?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the</para>
  <para>flock.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird</para>
  <para>all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was</para>
  <para>a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed</para>
  <para>until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My</para>
  <para>heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I</para>
  <para>knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,</para>
  <para>rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There</para>
  <para>was not a bird to be seen there.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Which dealer's?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same</para>
  <para>as the one I chose?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never</para>
  <para>tell them apart.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my</para>
  <para>feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the</para>
  <para>lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they</para>
  <para>had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always</para>
  <para>answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.</para>
  <para>Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself</para>
  <para>a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which</para>
  <para>I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into</para>
  <para>convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and</para>
  <para>by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the</para>
  <para>edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Get out!" said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No more words. Get out!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon</para>
  <para>the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running</para>
  <para>footfalls from the street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his</para>
  <para>clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their</para>
  <para>deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;</para>
  <para>but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must</para>
  <para>collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just</para>
  <para>possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong</para>
  <para>again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and</para>
  <para>you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of</para>
  <para>forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and</para>
  <para>whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you</para>
  <para>will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin</para>
  <para>another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief</para>
  <para>feature."</para>

  <para>VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND</para>
  <para/>
  <para>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I</para>
  <para>have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number</para>
  <para>merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did</para>
  <para>rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of</para>
  <para>wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation</para>
  <para>which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.</para>
  <para>Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which</para>
  <para>presented more singular features than that which was associated</para>
  <para>with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.</para>
  <para>The events in question occurred in the early days of my</para>
  <para>association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors</para>
  <para>in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them</para>
  <para>upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the</para>
  <para>time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by</para>
  <para>the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It</para>
  <para>is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I</para>
  <para>have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the</para>
  <para>death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even</para>
  <para>more terrible than the truth.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to</para>
  <para>find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my</para>
  <para>bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the</para>
  <para>mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I</para>
  <para>blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little</para>
  <para>resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the</para>
  <para>common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she</para>
  <para>retorted upon me, and I on you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What is it, then--a fire?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a</para>
  <para>considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She</para>
  <para>is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander</para>
  <para>about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock</para>
  <para>sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is</para>
  <para>something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it</para>
  <para>prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to</para>
  <para>follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should</para>
  <para>call you and give you the chance."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his</para>
  <para>professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid</para>
  <para>deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a</para>
  <para>logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were</para>
  <para>submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in</para>
  <para>a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A</para>
  <para>lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in</para>
  <para>the window, rose as we entered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock</para>
  <para>Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,</para>
  <para>before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am</para>
  <para>glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the</para>
  <para>fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot</para>
  <para>coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low</para>
  <para>voice, changing her seat as requested.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as</para>
  <para>she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable</para>
  <para>state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless</para>
  <para>frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features</para>
  <para>and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot</para>
  <para>with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,</para>
  <para>all-comprehensive glances.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and</para>
  <para>patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no</para>
  <para>doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You know me, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm</para>
  <para>of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had</para>
  <para>a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached</para>
  <para>the station."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my</para>
  <para>companion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left</para>
  <para>arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven</para>
  <para>places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a</para>
  <para>dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you</para>
  <para>sit on the left-hand side of the driver."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said</para>
  <para>she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at</para>
  <para>twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I</para>
  <para>can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.</para>
  <para>I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,</para>
  <para>and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,</para>
  <para>Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you</para>
  <para>helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had</para>
  <para>your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,</para>
  <para>too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness</para>
  <para>which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward</para>
  <para>you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be</para>
  <para>married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you</para>
  <para>shall not find me ungrateful."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small</para>
  <para>case-book, which he consulted.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was</para>
  <para>concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,</para>
  <para>Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote</para>
  <para>the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to</para>
  <para>reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty</para>
  <para>to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which</para>
  <para>suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us</para>
  <para>everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the</para>
  <para>matter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation</para>
  <para>lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions</para>
  <para>depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to</para>
  <para>another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to</para>
  <para>look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it</para>
  <para>as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can</para>
  <para>read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have</para>
  <para>heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold</para>
  <para>wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid</para>
  <para>the dangers which encompass me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am all attention, madam."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who</para>
  <para>is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in</para>
  <para>England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of</para>
  <para>Surrey."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the</para>
  <para>estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,</para>
  <para>and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four</para>
  <para>successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,</para>
  <para>and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the</para>
  <para>days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,</para>
  <para>and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under</para>
  <para>a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence</para>
  <para>there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but</para>
  <para>his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to</para>
  <para>the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which</para>
  <para>enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,</para>
  <para>where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he</para>
  <para>established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused</para>
  <para>by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he</para>
  <para>beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital</para>
  <para>sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and</para>
  <para>afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,</para>
  <para>the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.</para>
  <para>My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old</para>
  <para>at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable</para>
  <para>sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she</para>
  <para>bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,</para>
  <para>with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to</para>
  <para>each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return</para>
  <para>to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a</para>
  <para>railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his</para>
  <para>attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us</para>
  <para>to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The</para>
  <para>money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and</para>
  <para>there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.</para>
  <para>Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our</para>
  <para>neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of</para>
  <para>Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in</para>
  <para>his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious</para>
  <para>quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper</para>
  <para>approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the</para>
  <para>family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been</para>
  <para>intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of</para>
  <para>disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the</para>
  <para>police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,</para>
  <para>and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of</para>
  <para>immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a</para>
  <para>stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I</para>
  <para>could gather together that I was able to avert another public</para>
  <para>exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,</para>
  <para>and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few</para>
  <para>acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,</para>
  <para>and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,</para>
  <para>wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a</para>
  <para>passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a</para>
  <para>correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,</para>
  <para>which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the</para>
  <para>villagers almost as much as their master.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I</para>
  <para>had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with</para>
  <para>us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was</para>
  <para>but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already</para>
  <para>begun to whiten, even as mine has."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your sister is dead, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish</para>
  <para>to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I</para>
  <para>have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own</para>
  <para>age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden</para>
  <para>sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we</para>
  <para>were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's</para>
  <para>house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there</para>
  <para>a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My</para>
  <para>stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and</para>
  <para>offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of</para>
  <para>the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event</para>
  <para>occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes</para>
  <para>closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his</para>
  <para>lids now and glanced across at his visitor.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray be precise as to details," said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful</para>
  <para>time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have</para>
  <para>already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The</para>
  <para>bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms</para>
  <para>being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms</para>
  <para>the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third</para>
  <para>my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open</para>
  <para>out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Perfectly so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That</para>
  <para>fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we</para>
  <para>knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled</para>
  <para>by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom</para>
  <para>to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where</para>
  <para>she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At</para>
  <para>eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door</para>
  <para>and looked back.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle</para>
  <para>in the dead of the night?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Never,' said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in</para>
  <para>your sleep?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Certainly not. But why?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three</para>
  <para>in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,</para>
  <para>and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps</para>
  <para>from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would</para>
  <para>just ask you whether you had heard it.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the</para>
  <para>plantation.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you</para>
  <para>did not hear it also.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled</para>
  <para>back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her</para>
  <para>key turn in the lock."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock</para>
  <para>yourselves in at night?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Always."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And why?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah</para>
  <para>and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were</para>
  <para>locked."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending</para>
  <para>misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,</para>
  <para>were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two</para>
  <para>souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind</para>
  <para>was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing</para>
  <para>against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,</para>
  <para>there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew</para>
  <para>that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a</para>
  <para>shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door</para>
  <para>I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and</para>
  <para>a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had</para>
  <para>fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,</para>
  <para>and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it</para>
  <para>horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By</para>
  <para>the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the</para>
  <para>opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for</para>
  <para>help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a</para>
  <para>drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that</para>
  <para>moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.</para>
  <para>She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were</para>
  <para>dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not</para>
  <para>recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out</para>
  <para>in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was</para>
  <para>the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she</para>
  <para>would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the</para>
  <para>air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion</para>
  <para>seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for</para>
  <para>my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his</para>
  <para>dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was</para>
  <para>unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent</para>
  <para>for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for</para>
  <para>she slowly sank and died without having recovered her</para>
  <para>consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and</para>
  <para>metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is</para>
  <para>my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of</para>
  <para>the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have</para>
  <para>been deceived."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Was your sister dressed?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the</para>
  <para>charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when</para>
  <para>the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did</para>
  <para>the coroner come to?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's</para>
  <para>conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable</para>
  <para>to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that</para>
  <para>the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows</para>
  <para>were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,</para>
  <para>which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,</para>
  <para>and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was</para>
  <para>also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is</para>
  <para>wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,</para>
  <para>therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.</para>
  <para>Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How about poison?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,</para>
  <para>though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, there are nearly always some there."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a</para>
  <para>speckled band?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of</para>
  <para>delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of</para>
  <para>people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not</para>
  <para>know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear</para>
  <para>over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which</para>
  <para>she used."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your</para>
  <para>narrative."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until</para>
  <para>lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,</para>
  <para>whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask</para>
  <para>my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the</para>
  <para>second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My</para>
  <para>stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to</para>
  <para>be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs</para>
  <para>were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom</para>
  <para>wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the</para>
  <para>chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in</para>
  <para>which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last</para>
  <para>night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I</para>
  <para>suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which</para>
  <para>had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the</para>
  <para>lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to</para>
  <para>go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was</para>
  <para>daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which</para>
  <para>is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on</para>
  <para>this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your</para>
  <para>advice."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me</para>
  <para>all?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why, what do you mean?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which</para>
  <para>fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little</para>
  <para>livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed</para>
  <para>upon the white wrist.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He</para>
  <para>is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own</para>
  <para>strength."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin</para>
  <para>upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a</para>
  <para>thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide</para>
  <para>upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If</para>
  <para>we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for</para>
  <para>us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your</para>
  <para>stepfather?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some</para>
  <para>most important business. It is probable that he will be away all</para>
  <para>day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a</para>
  <para>housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily</para>
  <para>get her out of the way."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"By no means."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am</para>
  <para>in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to</para>
  <para>be there in time for your coming."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some</para>
  <para>small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and</para>
  <para>breakfast?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have</para>
  <para>confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you</para>
  <para>again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her</para>
  <para>face and glided from the room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes,</para>
  <para>leaning back in his chair.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Dark enough and sinister enough."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls</para>
  <para>are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,</para>
  <para>then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her</para>
  <para>mysterious end."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the</para>
  <para>very peculiar words of the dying woman?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot think."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of</para>
  <para>a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,</para>
  <para>the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has</para>
  <para>an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying</para>
  <para>allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner</para>
  <para>heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of</para>
  <para>those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its</para>
  <para>place, I think that there is good ground to think that the</para>
  <para>mystery may be cleared along those lines."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot imagine."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see many objections to any such theory."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going</para>
  <para>to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are</para>
  <para>fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of</para>
  <para>the devil!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that</para>
  <para>our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had</para>
  <para>framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar</para>
  <para>mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a</para>
  <para>black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,</para>
  <para>with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his</para>
  <para>hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his</para>
  <para>breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,</para>
  <para>seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and</para>
  <para>marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other</para>
  <para>of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,</para>
  <para>fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old</para>
  <para>bird of prey.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my</para>
  <para>companion quietly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I</para>
  <para>have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man</para>
  <para>furiously.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my</para>
  <para>companion imperturbably.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step</para>
  <para>forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel!</para>
  <para>I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>My friend smiled.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Holmes, the busybody!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>His smile broadened.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most</para>
  <para>entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for</para>
  <para>there is a decided draught."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with</para>
  <para>my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!</para>
  <para>I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped</para>
  <para>swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with</para>
  <para>his huge brown hands.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and</para>
  <para>hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the</para>
  <para>room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am</para>
  <para>not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him</para>
  <para>that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke</para>
  <para>he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,</para>
  <para>straightened it out again.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official</para>
  <para>detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,</para>
  <para>however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer</para>
  <para>from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,</para>
  <para>Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk</para>
  <para>down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may</para>
  <para>help us in this matter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his</para>
  <para>excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled</para>
  <para>over with notes and figures.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To</para>
  <para>determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the</para>
  <para>present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The</para>
  <para>total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little</para>
  <para>short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural</para>
  <para>prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an</para>
  <para>income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,</para>
  <para>therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have</para>
  <para>had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to</para>
  <para>a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,</para>
  <para>since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for</para>
  <para>standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,</para>
  <para>this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is</para>
  <para>aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you</para>
  <para>are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be</para>
  <para>very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your</para>
  <para>pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen</para>
  <para>who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush</para>
  <para>are, I think, all that we need."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for</para>
  <para>Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove</para>
  <para>for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a</para>
  <para>perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the</para>
  <para>heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out</para>
  <para>their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant</para>
  <para>smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange</para>
  <para>contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this</para>
  <para>sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in</para>
  <para>the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over</para>
  <para>his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the</para>
  <para>deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the</para>
  <para>shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Look there!" said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,</para>
  <para>thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the</para>
  <para>branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a</para>
  <para>very old mansion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Stoke Moran?" said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked</para>
  <para>the driver.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is</para>
  <para>where we are going."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of</para>
  <para>roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the</para>
  <para>house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by</para>
  <para>the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is</para>
  <para>walking."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading</para>
  <para>his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way</para>
  <para>to Leatherhead.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,</para>
  <para>"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or</para>
  <para>on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.</para>
  <para>Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as</para>
  <para>our word."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a</para>
  <para>face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for</para>
  <para>you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned</para>
  <para>out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely</para>
  <para>that he will be back before evening."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"</para>
  <para>said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had</para>
  <para>occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So it appears."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What</para>
  <para>will he say when he returns?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone</para>
  <para>more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself</para>
  <para>up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to</para>
  <para>your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our</para>
  <para>time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to</para>
  <para>examine."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high</para>
  <para>central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,</para>
  <para>thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were</para>
  <para>broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly</para>
  <para>caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little</para>
  <para>better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,</para>
  <para>and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up</para>
  <para>from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.</para>
  <para>Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the</para>
  <para>stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any</para>
  <para>workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and</para>
  <para>down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the</para>
  <para>outsides of the windows.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,</para>
  <para>the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main</para>
  <para>building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does</para>
  <para>not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end</para>
  <para>wall."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from</para>
  <para>my room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow</para>
  <para>wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There</para>
  <para>are windows in it, of course?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass</para>
  <para>through."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were</para>
  <para>unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness</para>
  <para>to go into your room and bar your shutters?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination</para>
  <para>through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the</para>
  <para>shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through</para>
  <para>which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his</para>
  <para>lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built</para>
  <para>firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his</para>
  <para>chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some</para>
  <para>difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were</para>
  <para>bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon</para>
  <para>the matter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which</para>
  <para>the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third</para>
  <para>chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss</para>
  <para>Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her</para>
  <para>fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a</para>
  <para>gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A</para>
  <para>brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow</para>
  <para>white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the</para>
  <para>left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small</para>
  <para>wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save</para>
  <para>for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and</para>
  <para>the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old</para>
  <para>and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building</para>
  <para>of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat</para>
  <para>silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,</para>
  <para>taking in every detail of the apartment.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last</para>
  <para>pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the</para>
  <para>tassel actually lying upon the pillow.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It goes to the housekeeper's room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It looks newer than the other things?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we</para>
  <para>wanted for ourselves."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.</para>
  <para>You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to</para>
  <para>this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in</para>
  <para>his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining</para>
  <para>minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with</para>
  <para>the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he</para>
  <para>walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and</para>
  <para>in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the</para>
  <para>bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why, it's a dummy," said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Won't it ring?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.</para>
  <para>You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where</para>
  <para>the little opening for the ventilator is."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are</para>
  <para>one or two very singular points about this room. For example,</para>
  <para>what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another</para>
  <para>room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated</para>
  <para>with the outside air!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is also quite modern," said the lady.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that</para>
  <para>time."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy</para>
  <para>bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your</para>
  <para>permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into</para>
  <para>the inner apartment."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his</para>
  <para>step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small</para>
  <para>wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an</para>
  <para>armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a</para>
  <para>round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things</para>
  <para>which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each</para>
  <para>and all of them with the keenest interest.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My stepfather's business papers."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of</para>
  <para>papers."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No. What a strange idea!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which</para>
  <para>stood on the top of it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a</para>
  <para>saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I</para>
  <para>daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He</para>
  <para>squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat</para>
  <para>of it with the greatest attention.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting</para>
  <para>his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on</para>
  <para>one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself</para>
  <para>and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What do you make of that, Watson?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be</para>
  <para>tied."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,</para>
  <para>and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst</para>
  <para>of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and</para>
  <para>with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as</para>
  <para>it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We</para>
  <para>had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss</para>
  <para>Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he</para>
  <para>roused himself from his reverie.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should</para>
  <para>absolutely follow my advice in every respect."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall most certainly do so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may</para>
  <para>depend upon your compliance."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I assure you that I am in your hands."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in</para>
  <para>your room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the</para>
  <para>village inn over there?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, that is the Crown."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Certainly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a</para>
  <para>headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him</para>
  <para>retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,</para>
  <para>undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then</para>
  <para>withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want</para>
  <para>into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in</para>
  <para>spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, easily."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The rest you will leave in our hands."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But what will you do?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate</para>
  <para>the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"</para>
  <para>said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Perhaps I have."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's</para>
  <para>death."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and</para>
  <para>if she died from some sudden fright."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more</para>
  <para>tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if</para>
  <para>Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.</para>
  <para>Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,</para>
  <para>you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers</para>
  <para>that threaten you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and</para>
  <para>sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and</para>
  <para>from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and</para>
  <para>of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw</para>
  <para>Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside</para>
  <para>the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some</para>
  <para>slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard</para>
  <para>the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which</para>
  <para>he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few</para>
  <para>minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as</para>
  <para>the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the</para>
  <para>gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you</para>
  <para>to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Can I be of assistance?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your presence might be invaluable."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I shall certainly come."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is very kind of you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms</para>
  <para>than was visible to me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine</para>
  <para>that you saw all that I did."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose</para>
  <para>that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You saw the ventilator, too?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to</para>
  <para>have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a</para>
  <para>rat could hardly pass through."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to</para>
  <para>Stoke Moran."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear Holmes!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her</para>
  <para>sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that</para>
  <para>suggested at once that there must be a communication between the</para>
  <para>two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been</para>
  <para>remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But what harm can there be in that?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A</para>
  <para>ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the</para>
  <para>bed dies. Does not that strike you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot as yet see any connection."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened</para>
  <para>like that before?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot say that I have."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same</para>
  <para>relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may</para>
  <para>call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.</para>
  <para>We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible</para>
  <para>crime."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong</para>
  <para>he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.</para>
  <para>Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.</para>
  <para>This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall</para>
  <para>be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough</para>
  <para>before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet</para>
  <para>pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more</para>
  <para>cheerful."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,</para>
  <para>and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours</para>
  <para>passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of</para>
  <para>eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it</para>
  <para>comes from the middle window."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,</para>
  <para>explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,</para>
  <para>and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A</para>
  <para>moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing</para>
  <para>in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us</para>
  <para>through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for</para>
  <para>unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way</para>
  <para>among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about</para>
  <para>to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel</para>
  <para>bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted</para>
  <para>child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and</para>
  <para>then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like</para>
  <para>a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low</para>
  <para>laugh and put his lips to my ear.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There</para>
  <para>was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders</para>
  <para>at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,</para>
  <para>after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I</para>
  <para>found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed</para>
  <para>the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes</para>
  <para>round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then</para>
  <para>creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered</para>
  <para>into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to</para>
  <para>distinguish the words:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I nodded to show that I had heard.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We must sit without light. He would see it through the</para>
  <para>ventilator."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I nodded again.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your</para>
  <para>pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of</para>
  <para>the bed, and you in that chair."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon</para>
  <para>the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the</para>
  <para>stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left</para>
  <para>in darkness.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a</para>
  <para>sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my</para>
  <para>companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same</para>
  <para>state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut</para>
  <para>off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at</para>
  <para>our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that</para>
  <para>the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the</para>
  <para>deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of</para>
  <para>an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and</para>
  <para>one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for</para>
  <para>whatever might befall.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the</para>
  <para>direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was</para>
  <para>succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.</para>
  <para>Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle</para>
  <para>sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the</para>
  <para>smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.</para>
  <para>Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,</para>
  <para>soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping</para>
  <para>continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes</para>
  <para>sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with</para>
  <para>his cane at the bell-pull.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I</para>
  <para>heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my</para>
  <para>weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which</para>
  <para>my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face</para>
  <para>was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had</para>
  <para>ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when</para>
  <para>suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most</para>
  <para>horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder</para>
  <para>and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled</para>
  <para>in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the</para>
  <para>village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the</para>
  <para>sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I</para>
  <para>stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it</para>
  <para>had died away into the silence from which it rose.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What can it mean?" I gasped.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps,</para>
  <para>after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will</para>
  <para>enter Dr. Roylott's room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the</para>
  <para>corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply</para>
  <para>from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his</para>
  <para>heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a</para>
  <para>dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant</para>
  <para>beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.</para>
  <para>Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott</para>
  <para>clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding</para>
  <para>beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.</para>
  <para>Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we</para>
  <para>had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his</para>
  <para>eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the</para>
  <para>ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with</para>
  <para>brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his</para>
  <para>head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began</para>
  <para>to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat</para>
  <para>diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in</para>
  <para>India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence</para>
  <para>does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls</para>
  <para>into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this</para>
  <para>creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to</para>
  <para>some place of shelter and let the county police know what has</para>
  <para>happened."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,</para>
  <para>and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from</para>
  <para>its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into</para>
  <para>the iron safe, which he closed upon it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of</para>
  <para>Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a</para>
  <para>narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling</para>
  <para>how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed</para>
  <para>her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,</para>
  <para>of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the</para>
  <para>conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly</para>
  <para>playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn</para>
  <para>of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back</para>
  <para>next day.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which</para>
  <para>shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from</para>
  <para>insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of</para>
  <para>the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to</para>
  <para>explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of</para>
  <para>by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an</para>
  <para>entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly</para>
  <para>reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me</para>
  <para>that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not</para>
  <para>come either from the window or the door. My attention was</para>
  <para>speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this</para>
  <para>ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The</para>
  <para>discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to</para>
  <para>the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was</para>
  <para>there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and</para>
  <para>coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,</para>
  <para>and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was</para>
  <para>furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I</para>
  <para>was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of</para>
  <para>poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical</para>
  <para>test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless</para>
  <para>man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such</para>
  <para>a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be</para>
  <para>an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could</para>
  <para>distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where</para>
  <para>the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the</para>
  <para>whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning</para>
  <para>light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by</para>
  <para>the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.</para>
  <para>He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he</para>
  <para>thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the</para>
  <para>rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the</para>
  <para>occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but</para>
  <para>sooner or later she must fall a victim.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his</para>
  <para>room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in</para>
  <para>the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary</para>
  <para>in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the</para>
  <para>safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to</para>
  <para>finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic</para>
  <para>clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather</para>
  <para>hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.</para>
  <para>Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in</para>
  <para>order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss</para>
  <para>as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the</para>
  <para>light and attacked it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master</para>
  <para>at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and</para>
  <para>roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person</para>
  <para>it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.</para>
  <para>Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to</para>
  <para>weigh very heavily upon my conscience."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,</para>
  <para>there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his</para>
  <para>notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel</para>
  <para>Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a</para>
  <para>finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was</para>
  <para>so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that</para>
  <para>it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it</para>
  <para>gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of</para>
  <para>reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story</para>
  <para>has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,</para>
  <para>like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when</para>
  <para>set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the</para>
  <para>facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears</para>
  <para>gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads</para>
  <para>on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a</para>
  <para>deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly</para>
  <para>served to weaken the effect.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the</para>
  <para>events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned</para>
  <para>to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker</para>
  <para>Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally</para>
  <para>even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come</para>
  <para>and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I</para>
  <para>happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington</para>
  <para>Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of</para>
  <para>these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was</para>
  <para>never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send</para>
  <para>me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by</para>
  <para>the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come</para>
  <para>from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I</para>
  <para>dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases</para>
  <para>were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my</para>
  <para>old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door</para>
  <para>tightly behind him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his</para>
  <para>shoulder; "he's all right."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was</para>
  <para>some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him</para>
  <para>round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe</para>
  <para>and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the</para>
  <para>same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even</para>
  <para>giving me time to thank him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the</para>
  <para>table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a</para>
  <para>soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of</para>
  <para>his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all</para>
  <para>over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than</para>
  <para>five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but</para>
  <para>he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who</para>
  <para>was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his</para>
  <para>strength of mind to control.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I</para>
  <para>have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by</para>
  <para>train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I</para>
  <para>might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me</para>
  <para>here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon</para>
  <para>the side-table."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic</para>
  <para>engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,</para>
  <para>style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have</para>
  <para>kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You</para>
  <para>are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself</para>
  <para>a monotonous occupation."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and</para>
  <para>laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,</para>
  <para>leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical</para>
  <para>instincts rose up against that laugh.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out</para>
  <para>some water from a caraffe.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical</para>
  <para>outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis</para>
  <para>is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very</para>
  <para>weary and pale-looking.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water,</para>
  <para>and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would</para>
  <para>kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb</para>
  <para>used to be."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even</para>
  <para>my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four</para>
  <para>protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the</para>
  <para>thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from</para>
  <para>the roots.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have</para>
  <para>bled considerably."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must</para>
  <para>have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that</para>
  <para>it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very</para>
  <para>tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own</para>
  <para>province."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very</para>
  <para>heavy and sharp instrument."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A thing like a cleaver," said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"An accident, I presume?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"By no means."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What! a murderous attack?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very murderous indeed."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You horrify me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered</para>
  <para>it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back</para>
  <para>without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.</para>
  <para>I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently</para>
  <para>trying to your nerves."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;</para>
  <para>but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing</para>
  <para>evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they</para>
  <para>believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I</para>
  <para>have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,</para>
  <para>even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so</para>
  <para>vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem</para>
  <para>which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you</para>
  <para>to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the</para>
  <para>official police."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I</para>
  <para>should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of</para>
  <para>course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me</para>
  <para>an introduction to him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I should be immensely obliged to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to</para>
  <para>have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an</para>
  <para>instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my</para>
  <para>wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my</para>
  <para>new acquaintance to Baker Street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his</para>
  <para>sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The</para>
  <para>Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed</para>
  <para>of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day</para>
  <para>before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the</para>
  <para>mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,</para>
  <para>ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.</para>
  <para>When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the</para>
  <para>sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of</para>
  <para>brandy and water within his reach.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,</para>
  <para>Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself</para>
  <para>absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are</para>
  <para>tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you," said my patient, "but I have felt another man since</para>
  <para>the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has</para>
  <para>completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable</para>
  <para>time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar</para>
  <para>experiences."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded</para>
  <para>expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat</para>
  <para>opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story</para>
  <para>which our visitor detailed to us.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,</para>
  <para>residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a</para>
  <para>hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my</para>
  <para>work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &amp;</para>
  <para>Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,</para>
  <para>having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of</para>
  <para>money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in</para>
  <para>business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria</para>
  <para>Street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in</para>
  <para>business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.</para>
  <para>During two years I have had three consultations and one small</para>
  <para>job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought</para>
  <para>me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from</para>
  <para>nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my</para>
  <para>little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to</para>
  <para>believe that I should never have any practice at all.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the</para>
  <para>office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who</para>
  <para>wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with</para>
  <para>the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at</para>
  <para>his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle</para>
  <para>size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have</para>
  <para>ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose</para>
  <para>and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over</para>
  <para>his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his</para>
  <para>natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his</para>
  <para>step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly</para>
  <para>dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than</para>
  <para>thirty.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.</para>
  <para>'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man</para>
  <para>who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet</para>
  <para>and capable of preserving a secret.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an</para>
  <para>address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just</para>
  <para>at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both</para>
  <para>an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if</para>
  <para>I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional</para>
  <para>qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter</para>
  <para>that you wished to speak to me?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to</para>
  <para>the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute</para>
  <para>secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and</para>
  <para>of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than</para>
  <para>from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely</para>
  <para>depend upon my doing so.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I</para>
  <para>had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, I promise.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No</para>
  <para>reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I have already given you my word.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning</para>
  <para>across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was</para>
  <para>empty.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are</para>
  <para>sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk</para>
  <para>in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to</para>
  <para>stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun</para>
  <para>to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.</para>
  <para>Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from</para>
  <para>showing my impatience.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time</para>
  <para>is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the</para>
  <para>words came to my lips.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Most admirably.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I</para>
  <para>simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which</para>
  <para>has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon</para>
  <para>set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as</para>
  <para>that?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last</para>
  <para>train.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Where to?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders</para>
  <para>of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a</para>
  <para>train from Paddington which would bring you there at about</para>
  <para>11:15.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Very good.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'There is a drive, then?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good</para>
  <para>seven miles from Eyford Station.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there</para>
  <para>would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop</para>
  <para>the night.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient</para>
  <para>hour?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to</para>
  <para>recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a</para>
  <para>young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the</para>
  <para>very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would</para>
  <para>like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do</para>
  <para>so.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they</para>
  <para>would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to</para>
  <para>accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to</para>
  <para>understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to</para>
  <para>do.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which</para>
  <para>we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I</para>
  <para>have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all</para>
  <para>laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from</para>
  <para>eavesdroppers?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Entirely.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that</para>
  <para>fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found</para>
  <para>in one or two places in England?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I have heard so.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small</para>
  <para>place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to</para>
  <para>discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my</para>
  <para>fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a</para>
  <para>comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two</para>
  <para>very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,</para>
  <para>however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were</para>
  <para>absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was</para>
  <para>quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my</para>
  <para>interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,</para>
  <para>but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I</para>
  <para>took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they</para>
  <para>suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little</para>
  <para>deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would</para>
  <para>enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been</para>
  <para>doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we</para>
  <para>erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already</para>
  <para>explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the</para>
  <para>subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it</para>
  <para>once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our</para>
  <para>little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts</para>
  <para>came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these</para>
  <para>fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you</para>
  <para>promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are</para>
  <para>going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not</para>
  <para>quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press</para>
  <para>in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out</para>
  <para>like gravel from a pit.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress</para>
  <para>the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing</para>
  <para>what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully</para>
  <para>into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I</para>
  <para>trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at</para>
  <para>Eyford at 11:15.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I shall certainly be there.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,</para>
  <para>questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank</para>
  <para>grasp, he hurried from the room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very</para>
  <para>much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission</para>
  <para>which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was</para>
  <para>glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked</para>
  <para>had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that</para>
  <para>this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face</para>
  <para>and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon</para>
  <para>me, and I could not think that his explanation of the</para>
  <para>fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my</para>
  <para>coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell</para>
  <para>anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate</para>
  <para>a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having</para>
  <para>obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.</para>
  <para>However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I</para>
  <para>reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the</para>
  <para>only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the</para>
  <para>platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed</para>
  <para>out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of</para>
  <para>the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a</para>
  <para>word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door</para>
  <para>of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either</para>
  <para>side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the</para>
  <para>horse could go."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One horse?" interjected Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, only one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Did you observe the colour?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the</para>
  <para>carriage. It was a chestnut."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Tired-looking or fresh?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, fresh and glossy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue</para>
  <para>your most interesting statement."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel</para>
  <para>Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I</para>
  <para>should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the</para>
  <para>time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat</para>
  <para>at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than</para>
  <para>once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me</para>
  <para>with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good</para>
  <para>in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I</para>
  <para>tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we</para>
  <para>were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out</para>
  <para>nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now</para>
  <para>and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the</para>
  <para>journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the</para>
  <para>conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the</para>
  <para>road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,</para>
  <para>and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang</para>
  <para>out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch</para>
  <para>which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of</para>
  <para>the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the</para>
  <para>most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that</para>
  <para>I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,</para>
  <para>and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage</para>
  <para>drove away.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled</para>
  <para>about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.</para>
  <para>Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a</para>
  <para>long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew</para>
  <para>broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she</para>
  <para>held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.</para>
  <para>I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which</para>
  <para>the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich</para>
  <para>material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as</para>
  <para>though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a</para>
  <para>gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly</para>
  <para>fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered</para>
  <para>something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room</para>
  <para>from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the</para>
  <para>lamp in his hand.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a</para>
  <para>few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a</para>
  <para>quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the</para>
  <para>centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel</para>
  <para>Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the</para>
  <para>door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and</para>
  <para>vanished into the darkness.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my</para>
  <para>ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises</para>
  <para>on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked</para>
  <para>across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of</para>
  <para>the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded</para>
  <para>across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old</para>
  <para>clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise</para>
  <para>everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began</para>
  <para>to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were</para>
  <para>they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And</para>
  <para>where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was</para>
  <para>all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no</para>
  <para>idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,</para>
  <para>were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,</para>
  <para>after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,</para>
  <para>that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,</para>
  <para>humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling</para>
  <para>that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the</para>
  <para>utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman</para>
  <para>was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind</para>
  <para>her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and</para>
  <para>beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with</para>
  <para>fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one</para>
  <para>shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few</para>
  <para>whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,</para>
  <para>like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to</para>
  <para>speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no</para>
  <para>good for you to do.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I</para>
  <para>cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass</para>
  <para>through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled</para>
  <para>and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and</para>
  <para>made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love</para>
  <para>of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too</para>
  <para>late!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to</para>
  <para>engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I</para>
  <para>thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of</para>
  <para>the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to</para>
  <para>go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried</para>
  <para>out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This</para>
  <para>woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout</para>
  <para>bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I</para>
  <para>cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention</para>
  <para>of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties</para>
  <para>when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps</para>
  <para>was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up</para>
  <para>her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and</para>
  <para>as noiselessly as she had come.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man</para>
  <para>with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double</para>
  <para>chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the</para>
  <para>way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just</para>
  <para>now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I</para>
  <para>felt the room to be a little close.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had</para>
  <para>better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I</para>
  <para>will take you up to see the machine.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.</para>
  <para>All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us</para>
  <para>know what is wrong with it.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the</para>
  <para>fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,</para>
  <para>with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little</para>
  <para>low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the</para>
  <para>generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no</para>
  <para>signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster</para>
  <para>was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in</para>
  <para>green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an</para>
  <para>air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the</para>
  <para>lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon</para>
  <para>my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent</para>
  <para>man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at</para>
  <para>least a fellow-countryman.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which</para>
  <para>he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three</para>
  <para>of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,</para>
  <para>and the colonel ushered me in.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and</para>
  <para>it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were</para>
  <para>to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the</para>
  <para>end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of</para>
  <para>many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns</para>
  <para>of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and</para>
  <para>multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine</para>
  <para>goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working</para>
  <para>of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will</para>
  <para>have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set</para>
  <para>it right.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very</para>
  <para>thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of</para>
  <para>exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and</para>
  <para>pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by</para>
  <para>the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed</para>
  <para>a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An</para>
  <para>examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was</para>
  <para>round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to</para>
  <para>fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause</para>
  <para>of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who</para>
  <para>followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical</para>
  <para>questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I</para>
  <para>had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the</para>
  <para>machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.</para>
  <para>It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth</para>
  <para>was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose</para>
  <para>that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a</para>
  <para>purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a</para>
  <para>large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a</para>
  <para>crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was</para>
  <para>scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a</para>
  <para>muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the</para>
  <para>colonel looking down at me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'What are you doing there?' he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as</para>
  <para>that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'</para>
  <para>said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to</para>
  <para>your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it</para>
  <para>was used.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of</para>
  <para>my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in</para>
  <para>his grey eyes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He</para>
  <para>took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key</para>
  <para>in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it</para>
  <para>was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and</para>
  <para>shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my</para>
  <para>heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish</para>
  <para>of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp</para>
  <para>still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining</para>
  <para>the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming</para>
  <para>down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than</para>
  <para>myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a</para>
  <para>shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and</para>
  <para>dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let</para>
  <para>me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my</para>
  <para>cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with</para>
  <para>my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it</para>
  <para>flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend</para>
  <para>very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my</para>
  <para>face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to</para>
  <para>think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and</para>
  <para>yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black</para>
  <para>shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand</para>
  <para>erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope</para>
  <para>back to my heart.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the</para>
  <para>walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw</para>
  <para>a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which</para>
  <para>broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For</para>
  <para>an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door</para>
  <para>which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself</para>
  <para>through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had</para>
  <para>closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few</para>
  <para>moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me</para>
  <para>how narrow had been my escape.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and</para>
  <para>I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,</para>
  <para>while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,</para>
  <para>while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend</para>
  <para>whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a</para>
  <para>moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste</para>
  <para>the so-precious time, but come!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to</para>
  <para>my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding</para>
  <para>stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we</para>
  <para>reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of</para>
  <para>two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we</para>
  <para>were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about</para>
  <para>her like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door</para>
  <para>which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon</para>
  <para>was shining brightly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be</para>
  <para>that you can jump it.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the</para>
  <para>passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark</para>
  <para>rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a</para>
  <para>butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,</para>
  <para>flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and</para>
  <para>wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be</para>
  <para>more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I</para>
  <para>hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between</para>
  <para>my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,</para>
  <para>then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.</para>
  <para>The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at</para>
  <para>the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round</para>
  <para>him and tried to hold him back.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise</para>
  <para>after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be</para>
  <para>silent! Oh, he will be silent!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from</para>
  <para>her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me</para>
  <para>pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the</para>
  <para>window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and</para>
  <para>was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was</para>
  <para>conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the</para>
  <para>garden below.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and</para>
  <para>rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I</para>
  <para>understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,</para>
  <para>however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.</para>
  <para>I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and</para>
  <para>then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and</para>
  <para>that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my</para>
  <para>handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my</para>
  <para>ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the</para>
  <para>rose-bushes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been</para>
  <para>a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was</para>
  <para>breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with</para>
  <para>dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded</para>
  <para>thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the</para>
  <para>particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with</para>
  <para>the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But</para>
  <para>to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house</para>
  <para>nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the</para>
  <para>hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a</para>
  <para>long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the</para>
  <para>very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were</para>
  <para>it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed</para>
  <para>during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning</para>
  <para>train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The</para>
  <para>same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I</para>
  <para>arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel</para>
  <para>Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a</para>
  <para>carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was</para>
  <para>there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three</para>
  <para>miles off.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined</para>
  <para>to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the</para>
  <para>police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first</para>
  <para>to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to</para>
  <para>bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do</para>
  <para>exactly what you advise."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to</para>
  <para>this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down</para>
  <para>from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he</para>
  <para>placed his cuttings.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It</para>
  <para>appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:</para>
  <para>'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged</para>
  <para>twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten</para>
  <para>o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was</para>
  <para>dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that</para>
  <para>the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the</para>
  <para>girl said."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and</para>
  <para>desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should</para>
  <para>stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out</para>
  <para>pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,</para>
  <para>every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall</para>
  <para>go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for</para>
  <para>Eyford."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train</para>
  <para>together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.</para>
  <para>There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector</para>
  <para>Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.</para>
  <para>Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the</para>
  <para>seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford</para>
  <para>for its centre.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of</para>
  <para>ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere</para>
  <para>near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was an hour's good drive."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you</para>
  <para>were unconscious?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having</para>
  <para>been lifted and conveyed somewhere."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have</para>
  <para>spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.</para>
  <para>Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face</para>
  <para>in my life."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I</para>
  <para>have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon</para>
  <para>it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your</para>
  <para>opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is</para>
  <para>south, for the country is more deserted there."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And I say east," said my patient.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are</para>
  <para>several quiet little villages up there."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there,</para>
  <para>and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up</para>
  <para>any."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty</para>
  <para>diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do</para>
  <para>you give your casting vote to?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are all wrong."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But we can't all be."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the</para>
  <para>centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the</para>
  <para>horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that</para>
  <para>if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet</para>
  <para>thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature</para>
  <para>of this gang."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale,</para>
  <para>and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the</para>
  <para>place of silver."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"</para>
  <para>said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by</para>
  <para>the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could</para>
  <para>get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that</para>
  <para>showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this</para>
  <para>lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not</para>
  <para>destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into</para>
  <para>Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed</para>
  <para>up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and</para>
  <para>hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off</para>
  <para>again on its way.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When did it break out?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,</para>
  <para>and the whole place is in a blaze."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Whose house is it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Dr. Becher's."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very</para>
  <para>thin, with a long, sharp nose?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an</para>
  <para>Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a</para>
  <para>better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,</para>
  <para>a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as</para>
  <para>if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all</para>
  <para>hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low</para>
  <para>hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in</para>
  <para>front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in</para>
  <para>the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to</para>
  <para>keep the flames under.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is</para>
  <para>the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That</para>
  <para>second window is the one that I jumped from."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon</para>
  <para>them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,</para>
  <para>when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,</para>
  <para>though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to</para>
  <para>observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for</para>
  <para>your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are</para>
  <para>a good hundred miles off by now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this</para>
  <para>no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the</para>
  <para>sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a</para>
  <para>peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very</para>
  <para>bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but</para>
  <para>there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'</para>
  <para>ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their</para>
  <para>whereabouts.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements</para>
  <para>which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a</para>
  <para>newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.</para>
  <para>About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and</para>
  <para>they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,</para>
  <para>and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save</para>
  <para>some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of</para>
  <para>the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so</para>
  <para>dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored</para>
  <para>in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have</para>
  <para>explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been</para>
  <para>already referred to.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to</para>
  <para>the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained</para>
  <para>forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a</para>
  <para>very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two</para>
  <para>persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other</para>
  <para>unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the</para>
  <para>silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his</para>
  <para>companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out</para>
  <para>of the way of danger.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return</para>
  <para>once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I</para>
  <para>have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what</para>
  <para>have I gained?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of</para>
  <para>value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the</para>
  <para>reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your</para>
  <para>existence."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have</para>
  <para>long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles</para>
  <para>in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have</para>
  <para>eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the</para>
  <para>gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to</para>
  <para>believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to</para>
  <para>the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a</para>
  <para>considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no</para>
  <para>memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of</para>
  <para>this remarkable episode.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I</para>
  <para>was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came</para>
  <para>home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table</para>
  <para>waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather</para>
  <para>had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and</para>
  <para>the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as</para>
  <para>a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.</para>
  <para>With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had</para>
  <para>surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,</para>
  <para>saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and</para>
  <para>lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the</para>
  <para>envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's</para>
  <para>noble correspondent could be.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.</para>
  <para>"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a</para>
  <para>fish-monger and a tide-waiter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he</para>
  <para>answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more</para>
  <para>interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social</para>
  <para>summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not social, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, distinctly professional."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And from a noble client?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"One of the highest in England."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my</para>
  <para>client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his</para>
  <para>case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be</para>
  <para>wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the</para>
  <para>papers diligently of late, have you not?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in</para>
  <para>the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I</para>
  <para>read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The</para>
  <para>latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent</para>
  <para>events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his</para>
  <para>wedding?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord</para>
  <para>St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn</para>
  <para>over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.</para>
  <para>This is what he says:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I</para>
  <para>may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I</para>
  <para>have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you</para>
  <para>in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in</para>
  <para>connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is</para>
  <para>acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no</para>
  <para>objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that</para>
  <para>it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in</para>
  <para>the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that</para>
  <para>time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of</para>
  <para>paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,</para>
  <para>and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink</para>
  <para>upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes</para>
  <para>as he folded up the epistle.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an</para>
  <para>hour."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon</para>
  <para>the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in</para>
  <para>their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client</para>
  <para>is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of</para>
  <para>reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting</para>
  <para>down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsingham</para>
  <para>de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:</para>
  <para>Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'</para>
  <para>He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was</para>
  <para>Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The</para>
  <para>Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</para>
  <para>They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on</para>
  <para>the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in</para>
  <para>all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something</para>
  <para>more solid."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,</para>
  <para>"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as</para>
  <para>remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew</para>
  <para>that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the</para>
  <para>intrusion of other matters."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square</para>
  <para>furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it</para>
  <para>was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your</para>
  <para>newspaper selections."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal</para>
  <para>column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks</para>
  <para>back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if</para>
  <para>rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert</para>
  <para>St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty</para>
  <para>Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San</para>
  <para>Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long,</para>
  <para>thin legs towards the fire.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society</para>
  <para>papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a</para>
  <para>call for protection in the marriage market, for the present</para>
  <para>free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home</para>
  <para>product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great</para>
  <para>Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across</para>
  <para>the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last</para>
  <para>week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by</para>
  <para>these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself</para>
  <para>for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has</para>
  <para>now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty</para>
  <para>Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss</para>
  <para>Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much</para>
  <para>attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,</para>
  <para>and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to</para>
  <para>considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the</para>
  <para>future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has</para>
  <para>been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,</para>
  <para>and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small</para>
  <para>estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress</para>
  <para>is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to</para>
  <para>make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a</para>
  <para>British peeress.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post</para>
  <para>to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it</para>
  <para>would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen</para>
  <para>intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would</para>
  <para>return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been</para>
  <para>taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on</para>
  <para>Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had</para>
  <para>taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord</para>
  <para>Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices</para>
  <para>which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The vanishing of the lady."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When did she vanish, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At the wedding breakfast."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite</para>
  <para>dramatic, in fact."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during</para>
  <para>the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt</para>
  <para>as this. Pray let me have the details."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I warn you that they are very incomplete."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Perhaps we may make them less so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a</para>
  <para>morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is</para>
  <para>headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the</para>
  <para>greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which</para>
  <para>have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as</para>
  <para>shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the</para>
  <para>previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to</para>
  <para>confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently</para>
  <para>floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush</para>
  <para>the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it</para>
  <para>that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what</para>
  <para>is a common subject for conversation.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover</para>
  <para>Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the</para>
  <para>father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,</para>
  <para>Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the</para>
  <para>younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia</para>
  <para>Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of</para>
  <para>Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been</para>
  <para>prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a</para>
  <para>woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to</para>
  <para>force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging</para>
  <para>that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a</para>
  <para>painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler</para>
  <para>and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house</para>
  <para>before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast</para>
  <para>with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and</para>
  <para>retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some</para>
  <para>comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that</para>
  <para>she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an</para>
  <para>ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the</para>
  <para>footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus</para>
  <para>apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,</para>
  <para>believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his</para>
  <para>daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with</para>
  <para>the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with</para>
  <para>the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which</para>
  <para>will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very</para>
  <para>singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing</para>
  <para>had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There</para>
  <para>are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the</para>
  <para>police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the</para>
  <para>original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some</para>
  <para>other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange</para>
  <para>disappearance of the bride.'"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And is that all?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is</para>
  <para>a suggestive one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And it is--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,</para>
  <para>has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a</para>
  <para>danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom</para>
  <para>for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole</para>
  <para>case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the</para>
  <para>public press."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would</para>
  <para>not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,</para>
  <para>Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I</para>
  <para>have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not</para>
  <para>dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,</para>
  <para>if only as a check to my own memory."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open</para>
  <para>the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,</para>
  <para>high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about</para>
  <para>the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose</para>
  <para>pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His</para>
  <para>manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue</para>
  <para>impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little</para>
  <para>bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off</para>
  <para>his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin</para>
  <para>upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of</para>
  <para>foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,</para>
  <para>yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.</para>
  <para>He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to</para>
  <para>right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his</para>
  <para>golden eyeglasses.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray</para>
  <para>take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.</para>
  <para>Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this</para>
  <para>matter over."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,</para>
  <para>Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you</para>
  <para>have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,</para>
  <para>though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of</para>
  <para>society."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, I am descending."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I beg pardon."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My last client of the sort was a king."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The King of Scandinavia."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What! Had he lost his wife?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the</para>
  <para>affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to</para>
  <para>you in yours."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to</para>
  <para>my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may</para>
  <para>assist you in forming an opinion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public</para>
  <para>prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this</para>
  <para>article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it</para>
  <para>goes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could</para>
  <para>offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most</para>
  <para>directly by questioning you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray do so."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In San Francisco, a year ago."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You were travelling in the States?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Did you become engaged then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you were on a friendly footing?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was</para>
  <para>amused."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Her father is very rich?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And how did he make his money?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,</para>
  <para>invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your</para>
  <para>wife's character?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down</para>
  <para>into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was</para>
  <para>twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she</para>
  <para>ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or</para>
  <para>mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than</para>
  <para>from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,</para>
  <para>with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of</para>
  <para>traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She</para>
  <para>is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her</para>
  <para>resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the</para>
  <para>name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately</para>
  <para>cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I</para>
  <para>believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that</para>
  <para>anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have you her photograph?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the</para>
  <para>full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an</para>
  <para>ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect</para>
  <para>of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the</para>
  <para>exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he</para>
  <para>closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your</para>
  <para>acquaintance?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I</para>
  <para>met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now</para>
  <para>married her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a</para>
  <para>fait accompli?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the</para>
  <para>wedding?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Was she in good spirits?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our</para>
  <para>future lives."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the</para>
  <para>wedding?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the</para>
  <para>ceremony."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And did you observe any change in her then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had</para>
  <para>ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident</para>
  <para>however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible</para>
  <para>bearing upon the case."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray let us have it, for all that."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards</para>
  <para>the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it</para>
  <para>fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the</para>
  <para>gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not</para>
  <para>appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of</para>
  <para>the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our</para>
  <para>way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of</para>
  <para>the general public were present, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is</para>
  <para>open."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a</para>
  <para>common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But</para>
  <para>really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less</para>
  <para>cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do</para>
  <para>on re-entering her father's house?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I saw her in conversation with her maid."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And who is her maid?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California</para>
  <para>with her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A confidential servant?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed</para>
  <para>her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they</para>
  <para>look upon these things in a different way."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How long did she speak to this Alice?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You did not overhear what they said?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was</para>
  <para>accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she</para>
  <para>meant."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your</para>
  <para>wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She walked into the breakfast-room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On your arm?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.</para>
  <para>Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose</para>
  <para>hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She</para>
  <para>never came back."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to</para>
  <para>her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a</para>
  <para>bonnet, and went out."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in</para>
  <para>company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who</para>
  <para>had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that</para>
  <para>morning."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,</para>
  <para>and your relations to her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.</para>
  <para>"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on</para>
  <para>a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have</para>
  <para>not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of</para>
  <para>complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.</para>
  <para>Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and</para>
  <para>devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she</para>
  <para>heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the</para>
  <para>reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I</para>
  <para>feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to</para>
  <para>Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to</para>
  <para>push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my</para>
  <para>wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the</para>
  <para>possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police</para>
  <para>fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.</para>
  <para>She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a</para>
  <para>row."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Did your wife hear all this?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, thank goodness, she did not."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as</para>
  <para>so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid</para>
  <para>some terrible trap for her."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, it is a possible supposition."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You think so, too?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon</para>
  <para>this as likely?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray</para>
  <para>what is your own theory as to what took place?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I</para>
  <para>have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may</para>
  <para>say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of</para>
  <para>this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a</para>
  <para>social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous</para>
  <para>disturbance in my wife."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I</para>
  <para>will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to</para>
  <para>without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said</para>
  <para>Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have</para>
  <para>nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the</para>
  <para>breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.</para>
  <para>I shall communicate with you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our</para>
  <para>client, rising.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have solved it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Eh? What was that?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I say that I have solved it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where, then, is my wife?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take</para>
  <para>wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a</para>
  <para>stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting</para>
  <para>it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I</para>
  <para>think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all</para>
  <para>this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the</para>
  <para>case before our client came into the room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear Holmes!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I</para>
  <para>remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination</para>
  <para>served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial</para>
  <para>evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a</para>
  <para>trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But I have heard all that you have heard."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which</para>
  <para>serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some</para>
  <para>years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich</para>
  <para>the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these</para>
  <para>cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!</para>
  <para>You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are</para>
  <para>cigars in the box."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,</para>
  <para>which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a</para>
  <para>black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated</para>
  <para>himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You</para>
  <para>look dissatisfied."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage</para>
  <para>case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Really! You surprise me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip</para>
  <para>through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his</para>
  <para>hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In heaven's name, what for?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he</para>
  <para>asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why? What do you mean?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in</para>
  <para>the one as in the other."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you</para>
  <para>know all about it," he snarled.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in</para>
  <para>the matter?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think it very unlikely."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found</para>
  <para>this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the</para>
  <para>floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin</para>
  <para>shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked</para>
  <para>in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the</para>
  <para>top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master</para>
  <para>Holmes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.</para>
  <para>"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.</para>
  <para>They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me</para>
  <para>that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found</para>
  <para>in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope</para>
  <para>to arrive at through this?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I</para>
  <para>am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your</para>
  <para>deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as</para>
  <para>many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And how?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the</para>
  <para>card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it</para>
  <para>down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will</para>
  <para>see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all</para>
  <para>along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora</para>
  <para>Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was</para>
  <para>responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her</para>
  <para>initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped</para>
  <para>into her hand at the door and which lured her within their</para>
  <para>reach."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are</para>
  <para>very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a</para>
  <para>listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he</para>
  <para>gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important,"</para>
  <para>said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha! you find it so?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he</para>
  <para>shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On the contrary, this is the right side."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil</para>
  <para>over here."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel</para>
  <para>bill, which interests me deeply."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade.</para>
  <para>"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.</para>
  <para>6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the</para>
  <para>note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I</para>
  <para>congratulate you again."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in</para>
  <para>hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.</para>
  <para>Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom</para>
  <para>of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them</para>
  <para>into the bag, and made for the door.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival</para>
  <para>vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady</para>
  <para>St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any</para>
  <para>such person."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,</para>
  <para>tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and</para>
  <para>hurried away.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on</para>
  <para>his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about</para>
  <para>outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must</para>
  <para>leave you to your papers for a little."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had</para>
  <para>no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a</para>
  <para>confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked</para>
  <para>with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and</para>
  <para>presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean</para>
  <para>little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble</para>
  <para>lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold</para>
  <para>woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of</para>
  <para>ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,</para>
  <para>my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian</para>
  <para>Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid</para>
  <para>for and were ordered to this address.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the</para>
  <para>room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his</para>
  <para>eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his</para>
  <para>conclusions.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I</para>
  <para>am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I</para>
  <para>fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,</para>
  <para>dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very</para>
  <para>perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.</para>
  <para>Have you good authority for what you say?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The best possible."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his</para>
  <para>forehead.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of</para>
  <para>the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any</para>
  <para>humiliation."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the</para>
  <para>lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of</para>
  <para>doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she</para>
  <para>had no one to advise her at such a crisis."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,</para>
  <para>tapping his fingers upon the table.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so</para>
  <para>unprecedented a position."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have</para>
  <para>been shamefully used."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps</para>
  <para>on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view</para>
  <para>of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here</para>
  <para>who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a</para>
  <para>lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to</para>
  <para>introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I</para>
  <para>think, you have already met."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his</para>
  <para>seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand</para>
  <para>thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended</para>
  <para>dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out</para>
  <para>her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was</para>
  <para>as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was</para>
  <para>one which it was hard to resist.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every</para>
  <para>cause to be."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I</para>
  <para>should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of</para>
  <para>rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just</para>
  <para>didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't</para>
  <para>fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave</para>
  <para>the room while you explain this matter?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,</para>
  <para>"we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business</para>
  <para>already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to</para>
  <para>hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,</para>
  <para>clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here</para>
  <para>and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa</para>
  <para>was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;</para>
  <para>but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,</para>
  <para>while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to</para>
  <para>nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa</para>
  <para>wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took</para>
  <para>me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so</para>
  <para>he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything</para>
  <para>about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just</para>
  <para>fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and</para>
  <para>make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had</para>
  <para>as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of</para>
  <para>time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.</para>
  <para>'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and</para>
  <para>then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your</para>
  <para>husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had</para>
  <para>fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,</para>
  <para>that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek</para>
  <para>his fortune, and I went back to pa.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then</para>
  <para>he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New</para>
  <para>Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a</para>
  <para>miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was</para>
  <para>my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was</para>
  <para>very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took</para>
  <para>me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a</para>
  <para>year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really</para>
  <para>dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,</para>
  <para>and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt</para>
  <para>all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place</para>
  <para>in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done</para>
  <para>my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our</para>
  <para>actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make</para>
  <para>him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may</para>
  <para>imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I</para>
  <para>glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the</para>
  <para>first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked</para>
  <para>again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as</para>
  <para>if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I</para>
  <para>didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the</para>
  <para>words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my</para>
  <para>ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make</para>
  <para>a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to</para>
  <para>know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to</para>
  <para>tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,</para>
  <para>and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on</para>
  <para>the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the</para>
  <para>note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a</para>
  <para>line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.</para>
  <para>Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now</para>
  <para>to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,</para>
  <para>and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but</para>
  <para>to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to</para>
  <para>have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before</para>
  <para>his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to</para>
  <para>run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten</para>
  <para>minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of</para>
  <para>the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.</para>
  <para>I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman</para>
  <para>came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to</para>
  <para>me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little</para>
  <para>secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away</para>
  <para>from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and</para>
  <para>away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and</para>
  <para>that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank</para>
  <para>had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to</para>
  <para>'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to</para>
  <para>England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the</para>
  <para>very morning of my second wedding."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name</para>
  <para>and the church but not where the lady lived."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all</para>
  <para>for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I</para>
  <para>should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just</para>
  <para>sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It</para>
  <para>was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting</para>
  <para>round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So</para>
  <para>Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of</para>
  <para>them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away</para>
  <para>somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we</para>
  <para>should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good</para>
  <para>gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how</para>
  <para>he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very</para>
  <para>clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and</para>
  <para>that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so</para>
  <para>secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord</para>
  <para>St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at</para>
  <para>once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if</para>
  <para>I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very</para>
  <para>meanly of me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but</para>
  <para>had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this</para>
  <para>long narrative.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most</para>
  <para>intimate personal affairs in this public manner."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out</para>
  <para>his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us</para>
  <para>in a friendly supper."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his</para>
  <para>Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent</para>
  <para>developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over</para>
  <para>them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a</para>
  <para>very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and</para>
  <para>stalked out of the room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your</para>
  <para>company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an</para>
  <para>American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the</para>
  <para>folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone</para>
  <para>years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens</para>
  <para>of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a</para>
  <para>quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our</para>
  <para>visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how</para>
  <para>simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight</para>
  <para>seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural</para>
  <para>than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing</para>
  <para>stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.</para>
  <para>Lestrade of Scotland Yard."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that</para>
  <para>the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,</para>
  <para>the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of</para>
  <para>returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the</para>
  <para>morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that</para>
  <para>something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was</para>
  <para>out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she</para>
  <para>seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America</para>
  <para>because she had spent so short a time in this country that she</para>
  <para>could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence</para>
  <para>over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change</para>
  <para>her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a</para>
  <para>process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an</para>
  <para>American. Then who could this American be, and why should he</para>
  <para>possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might</para>
  <para>be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in</para>
  <para>rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got</para>
  <para>before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us</para>
  <para>of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so</para>
  <para>transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a</para>
  <para>bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very</para>
  <para>significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance</para>
  <para>means taking possession of that which another person has a prior</para>
  <para>claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had</para>
  <para>gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a</para>
  <para>previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And how in the world did you find them?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held</para>
  <para>information in his hands the value of which he did not himself</para>
  <para>know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,</para>
  <para>but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had</para>
  <para>settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How did you deduce the select?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence</para>
  <para>for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive</para>
  <para>hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.</para>
  <para>In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I</para>
  <para>learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an</para>
  <para>American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking</para>
  <para>over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I</para>
  <para>had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded</para>
  <para>to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate</para>
  <para>enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them</para>
  <para>some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be</para>
  <para>better in every way that they should make their position a little</para>
  <para>clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in</para>
  <para>particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I</para>
  <para>made him keep the appointment."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was</para>
  <para>certainly not very gracious."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be</para>
  <para>very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and</para>
  <para>wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of</para>
  <para>fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully</para>
  <para>and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in</para>
  <para>the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for</para>
  <para>the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away</para>
  <para>these bleak autumnal evenings."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking</para>
  <para>down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather</para>
  <para>sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands</para>
  <para>in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It</para>
  <para>was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day</para>
  <para>before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the</para>
  <para>wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed</para>
  <para>into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and</para>
  <para>on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as</para>
  <para>when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but</para>
  <para>was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer</para>
  <para>passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the</para>
  <para>Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman</para>
  <para>whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a</para>
  <para>massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was</para>
  <para>dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining</para>
  <para>hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet</para>
  <para>his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress</para>
  <para>and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little</para>
  <para>springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to</para>
  <para>set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and</para>
  <para>down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most</para>
  <para>extraordinary contortions.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is</para>
  <para>looking up at the numbers of the houses."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his</para>
  <para>hands.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Here?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I</para>
  <para>think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As</para>
  <para>he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and</para>
  <para>pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the</para>
  <para>clanging.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still</para>
  <para>gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in</para>
  <para>his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and</para>
  <para>pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his</para>
  <para>body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the</para>
  <para>extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his</para>
  <para>feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we</para>
  <para>both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.</para>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting</para>
  <para>beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,</para>
  <para>soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.</para>
  <para>"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have</para>
  <para>recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into</para>
  <para>any little problem which you may submit to me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting</para>
  <para>against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his</para>
  <para>brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my</para>
  <para>reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might</para>
  <para>have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet</para>
  <para>borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;</para>
  <para>but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have</para>
  <para>been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.</para>
  <para>The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found</para>
  <para>out of this horrible affair."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a</para>
  <para>clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen</para>
  <para>you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your</para>
  <para>ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &amp;</para>
  <para>Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior</para>
  <para>partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City</para>
  <para>of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the</para>
  <para>foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We</para>
  <para>waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced</para>
  <para>himself to tell his story.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened</para>
  <para>here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure</para>
  <para>your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and</para>
  <para>hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this</para>
  <para>snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who</para>
  <para>takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the</para>
  <para>facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking</para>
  <para>business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative</para>
  <para>investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection</para>
  <para>and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means</para>
  <para>of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security</para>
  <para>is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction</para>
  <para>during the last few years, and there are many noble families to</para>
  <para>whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their</para>
  <para>pictures, libraries, or plate.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a</para>
  <para>card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I</para>
  <para>saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps</para>
  <para>even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name</para>
  <para>which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,</para>
  <para>noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the</para>
  <para>honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged</para>
  <para>at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry</para>
  <para>quickly through a disagreeable task.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the</para>
  <para>habit of advancing money.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have</para>
  <para>50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a</para>
  <para>sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it</para>
  <para>a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my</para>
  <para>position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place</para>
  <para>one's self under obligations.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most</para>
  <para>certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you</para>
  <para>think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the</para>
  <para>money should be paid at once.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my</para>
  <para>own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be</para>
  <para>rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do</para>
  <para>it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must</para>
  <para>insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution</para>
  <para>should be taken.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a</para>
  <para>square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.</para>
  <para>'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,'</para>
  <para>said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,</para>
  <para>flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery</para>
  <para>which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said</para>
  <para>he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The</para>
  <para>lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the</para>
  <para>sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my</para>
  <para>security.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some</para>
  <para>perplexity from it to my illustrious client.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You doubt its value?' he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Not at all. I only doubt--'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest</para>
  <para>about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely</para>
  <para>certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a</para>
  <para>pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Ample.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof</para>
  <para>of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I</para>
  <para>have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to</para>
  <para>refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to</para>
  <para>preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I</para>
  <para>need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any</para>
  <para>harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as</para>
  <para>serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the</para>
  <para>world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.</para>
  <para>I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall</para>
  <para>call for it in person on Monday morning.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,</para>
  <para>calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000</para>
  <para>pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the</para>
  <para>precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not</para>
  <para>but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility</para>
  <para>which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it</para>
  <para>was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any</para>
  <para>misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever</para>
  <para>consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter</para>
  <para>the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned</para>
  <para>once more to my work.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave</para>
  <para>so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had</para>
  <para>been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how</para>
  <para>terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I</para>
  <para>determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always</para>
  <para>carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might</para>
  <para>never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a</para>
  <para>cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel</para>
  <para>with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs</para>
  <para>and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to</para>
  <para>thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep</para>
  <para>out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three</para>
  <para>maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose</para>
  <para>absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy</para>
  <para>Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few</para>
  <para>months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has</para>
  <para>always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has</para>
  <para>attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.</para>
  <para>That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we</para>
  <para>believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it</para>
  <para>will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an</para>
  <para>only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.</para>
  <para>Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am</para>
  <para>myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very</para>
  <para>likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I</para>
  <para>had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a</para>
  <para>moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it</para>
  <para>would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I</para>
  <para>meant it for the best.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my</para>
  <para>business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,</para>
  <para>wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the</para>
  <para>handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a</para>
  <para>member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming</para>
  <para>manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long</para>
  <para>purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards</para>
  <para>and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again</para>
  <para>to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his</para>
  <para>allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried</para>
  <para>more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he</para>
  <para>was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir</para>
  <para>George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George</para>
  <para>Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently</para>
  <para>brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could</para>
  <para>hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than</para>
  <para>Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been</para>
  <para>everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of</para>
  <para>great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far</para>
  <para>away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his</para>
  <para>cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that</para>
  <para>he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,</para>
  <para>too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into</para>
  <para>character.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but</para>
  <para>when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the</para>
  <para>world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my</para>
  <para>daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,</para>
  <para>a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and</para>
  <para>gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know</para>
  <para>what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone</para>
  <para>against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for</para>
  <para>he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I</para>
  <para>think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it</para>
  <para>would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his</para>
  <para>whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and</para>
  <para>I shall continue with my miserable story.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after</para>
  <para>dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious</para>
  <para>treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name</para>
  <para>of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am</para>
  <para>sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.</para>
  <para>Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous</para>
  <para>coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'In my own bureau.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the</para>
  <para>night.' said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It is locked up,' I answered.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I</para>
  <para>have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of</para>
  <para>what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with</para>
  <para>a very grave face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let</para>
  <para>me have 200 pounds?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too</para>
  <para>generous with you in money matters.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money,</para>
  <para>or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,'</para>
  <para>said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money</para>
  <para>in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try</para>
  <para>other means.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the</para>
  <para>month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which</para>
  <para>he bowed and left the room without another word.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my</para>
  <para>treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go</para>
  <para>round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I</para>
  <para>usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform</para>
  <para>myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself</para>
  <para>at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as</para>
  <para>I approached.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little</para>
  <para>disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out</para>
  <para>to-night?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Certainly not.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she</para>
  <para>has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that</para>
  <para>it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer</para>
  <para>it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Quite sure, dad.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom</para>
  <para>again, where I was soon asleep.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may</para>
  <para>have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question</para>
  <para>me upon any point which I do not make clear."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be</para>
  <para>particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety</para>
  <para>in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.</para>
  <para>About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in</para>
  <para>the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an</para>
  <para>impression behind it as though a window had gently closed</para>
  <para>somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my</para>
  <para>horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in</para>
  <para>the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,</para>
  <para>and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you</para>
  <para>touch that coronet?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,</para>
  <para>dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the</para>
  <para>light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be</para>
  <para>wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry</para>
  <para>he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I</para>
  <para>snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with</para>
  <para>three of the beryls in it, was missing.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have</para>
  <para>destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the</para>
  <para>jewels which you have stolen?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Stolen!' he cried.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I</para>
  <para>call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to</para>
  <para>tear off another piece?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it</para>
  <para>any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,</para>
  <para>since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in</para>
  <para>the morning and make my own way in the world.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried</para>
  <para>half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to</para>
  <para>the bottom.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such</para>
  <para>as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to</para>
  <para>call the police, let the police find what they can.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my</para>
  <para>voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,</para>
  <para>at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the</para>
  <para>whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the</para>
  <para>ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the</para>
  <para>investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a</para>
  <para>constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with</para>
  <para>his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge</para>
  <para>him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private</para>
  <para>matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was</para>
  <para>national property. I was determined that the law should have its</para>
  <para>way in everything.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It</para>
  <para>would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the</para>
  <para>house for five minutes.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you</para>
  <para>have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position</para>
  <para>in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only</para>
  <para>my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at</para>
  <para>stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would</para>
  <para>convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell</para>
  <para>me what he had done with the three missing stones.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught</para>
  <para>in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.</para>
  <para>If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling</para>
  <para>us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,</para>
  <para>turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened</para>
  <para>for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for</para>
  <para>it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search</para>
  <para>was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of</para>
  <para>every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed</para>
  <para>the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the</para>
  <para>wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our</para>
  <para>threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after</para>
  <para>going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to</para>
  <para>you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.</para>
  <para>The police have openly confessed that they can at present make</para>
  <para>nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think</para>
  <para>necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My</para>
  <para>God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son</para>
  <para>in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to</para>
  <para>and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got</para>
  <para>beyond words.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows</para>
  <para>knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you receive much company?" he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of</para>
  <para>Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No</para>
  <para>one else, I think."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you go out much in society?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for</para>
  <para>it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is unusual in a young girl."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She</para>
  <para>is four-and-twenty."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to</para>
  <para>her also."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet</para>
  <para>in his hands."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of</para>
  <para>the coronet at all injured?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, it was twisted."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to</para>
  <para>straighten it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.</para>
  <para>But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If</para>
  <para>his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?</para>
  <para>His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several</para>
  <para>singular points about the case. What did the police think of the</para>
  <para>noise which awoke you from your sleep?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his</para>
  <para>bedroom door."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door</para>
  <para>so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the</para>
  <para>disappearance of these gems?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture</para>
  <para>in the hope of finding them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has</para>
  <para>already been minutely examined."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes, "is it not obvious to you now</para>
  <para>that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you</para>
  <para>or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you</para>
  <para>to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider</para>
  <para>what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came</para>
  <para>down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,</para>
  <para>opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main</para>
  <para>force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,</para>
  <para>concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that</para>
  <para>nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six</para>
  <para>into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger</para>
  <para>of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of</para>
  <para>despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain</para>
  <para>them?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if</para>
  <para>you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,</para>
  <para>and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into</para>
  <para>details."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,</para>
  <para>which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy</para>
  <para>were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I</para>
  <para>confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be</para>
  <para>as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such</para>
  <para>faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some</para>
  <para>grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted</para>
  <para>explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the</para>
  <para>southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his</para>
  <para>hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client</para>
  <para>appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope</para>
  <para>which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a</para>
  <para>desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway</para>
  <para>journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest</para>
  <para>residence of the great financier.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing</para>
  <para>back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a</para>
  <para>snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates</para>
  <para>which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden</para>
  <para>thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges</para>
  <para>stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the</para>
  <para>tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the</para>
  <para>stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a</para>
  <para>public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing</para>
  <para>at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the</para>
  <para>front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden</para>
  <para>behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I</para>
  <para>went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should</para>
  <para>return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and</para>
  <para>a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,</para>
  <para>slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against</para>
  <para>the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever</para>
  <para>seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were</para>
  <para>bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept</para>
  <para>silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of</para>
  <para>grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the</para>
  <para>more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong</para>
  <para>character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding</para>
  <para>my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand</para>
  <para>over his head with a sweet womanly caress.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you</para>
  <para>not, dad?" she asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's</para>
  <para>instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will</para>
  <para>be sorry for having acted so harshly."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should</para>
  <para>suspect him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with</para>
  <para>the coronet in his hand?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take</para>
  <para>my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say</para>
  <para>no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in</para>
  <para>prison!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!</para>
  <para>Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences</para>
  <para>to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman</para>
  <para>down from London to inquire more deeply into it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in</para>
  <para>the stable lane now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he</para>
  <para>hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,</para>
  <para>that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,</para>
  <para>that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may</para>
  <para>prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the</para>
  <para>snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing</para>
  <para>Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You heard nothing yourself last night?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard</para>
  <para>that, and I came down."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you</para>
  <para>fasten all the windows?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Were they all fastened this morning?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked</para>
  <para>to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and</para>
  <para>who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her</para>
  <para>sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the</para>
  <para>banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with</para>
  <para>the coronet in his hands?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this</para>
  <para>girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I</para>
  <para>presume?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I</para>
  <para>met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you know him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.</para>
  <para>His name is Francis Prosper."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to</para>
  <para>say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, he did."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive</para>
  <para>black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you</para>
  <para>know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in</para>
  <para>Holmes' thin, eager face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall</para>
  <para>probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps</para>
  <para>I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at</para>
  <para>the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.</para>
  <para>This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill</para>
  <para>with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs,"</para>
  <para>said he at last.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little</para>
  <para>chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.</para>
  <para>Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the</para>
  <para>lumber-room."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have you it here?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is it on the dressing-table."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did</para>
  <para>not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must</para>
  <para>have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem</para>
  <para>he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the</para>
  <para>jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I</para>
  <para>have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,</para>
  <para>where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which</para>
  <para>corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I</para>
  <para>beg that you will break it off."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"</para>
  <para>said he.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but</para>
  <para>without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though</para>
  <para>I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my</para>
  <para>time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do</para>
  <para>you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would</para>
  <para>be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this</para>
  <para>happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard</para>
  <para>nothing of it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,</para>
  <para>Miss Holder?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary</para>
  <para>luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault</para>
  <para>if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your</para>
  <para>permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations</para>
  <para>outside."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any</para>
  <para>unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an</para>
  <para>hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet</para>
  <para>heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.</para>
  <para>Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my</para>
  <para>rooms."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot tell."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he</para>
  <para>cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My opinion is in no way altered."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was</para>
  <para>acted in my house last night?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow</para>
  <para>morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to</para>
  <para>make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to</para>
  <para>act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you</para>
  <para>place no limit on the sum I may draw."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I would give my fortune to have them back."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.</para>
  <para>Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here</para>
  <para>again before evening."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up</para>
  <para>about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than</para>
  <para>I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward</para>
  <para>journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always</para>
  <para>glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in</para>
  <para>despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our</para>
  <para>rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in</para>
  <para>a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned</para>
  <para>up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he</para>
  <para>was a perfect sample of the class.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass</para>
  <para>above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,</para>
  <para>Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in</para>
  <para>this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I</para>
  <para>shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few</para>
  <para>hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,</para>
  <para>sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this</para>
  <para>rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in</para>
  <para>excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his</para>
  <para>hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a</para>
  <para>cup of tea.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Where to?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time</para>
  <para>before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be</para>
  <para>late."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"How are you getting on?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham</para>
  <para>since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a</para>
  <para>very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a</para>
  <para>good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get</para>
  <para>these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly</para>
  <para>respectable self."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for</para>
  <para>satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,</para>
  <para>and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He</para>
  <para>hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of</para>
  <para>the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his</para>
  <para>congenial hunt.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so</para>
  <para>I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away</para>
  <para>for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that</para>
  <para>his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he</para>
  <para>came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there</para>
  <para>he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the</para>
  <para>other, as fresh and trim as possible.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but</para>
  <para>you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this</para>
  <para>morning."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be</para>
  <para>surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the</para>
  <para>change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally</para>
  <para>of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,</para>
  <para>while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered</para>
  <para>with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than</para>
  <para>his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into</para>
  <para>the armchair which I pushed forward for him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said</para>
  <para>he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without</para>
  <para>a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured</para>
  <para>age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,</para>
  <para>Mary, has deserted me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Deserted you?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was</para>
  <para>empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to</para>
  <para>her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had</para>
  <para>married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was</para>
  <para>thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers</para>
  <para>in this note:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,</para>
  <para>and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune</para>
  <para>might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my</para>
  <para>mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must</para>
  <para>leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is</para>
  <para>provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will</para>
  <para>be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in</para>
  <para>death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it</para>
  <para>points to suicide?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible</para>
  <para>solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of</para>
  <para>your troubles."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have</para>
  <para>learned something! Where are the gems?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for</para>
  <para>them?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I would pay ten."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.</para>
  <para>And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?</para>
  <para>Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes</para>
  <para>walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of</para>
  <para>gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and</para>
  <para>he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock</para>
  <para>Holmes rather sternly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that</para>
  <para>noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I</para>
  <para>should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to</para>
  <para>have one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him</para>
  <para>know that the truth is known."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an</para>
  <para>interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the</para>
  <para>story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was</para>
  <para>right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite</para>
  <para>clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his</para>
  <para>lips."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary</para>
  <para>mystery!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached</para>
  <para>it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me</para>
  <para>to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding</para>
  <para>between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now</para>
  <para>fled together."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My Mary? Impossible!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither</para>
  <para>you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you</para>
  <para>admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most</para>
  <para>dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely</para>
  <para>desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece</para>
  <para>knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he</para>
  <para>had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she</para>
  <para>alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,</para>
  <para>but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing</para>
  <para>him nearly every evening."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an</para>
  <para>ashen face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.</para>
  <para>Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,</para>
  <para>slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which</para>
  <para>leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right</para>
  <para>through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the</para>
  <para>coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he</para>
  <para>bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but</para>
  <para>there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all</para>
  <para>other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had</para>
  <para>hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming</para>
  <para>downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you</para>
  <para>about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,</para>
  <para>which was all perfectly true.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but</para>
  <para>he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.</para>
  <para>In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,</para>
  <para>so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin</para>
  <para>walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared</para>
  <para>into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad</para>
  <para>slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what</para>
  <para>would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the</para>
  <para>room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw</para>
  <para>that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed</para>
  <para>down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and</para>
  <para>slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see</para>
  <para>what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the</para>
  <para>window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then</para>
  <para>closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close</para>
  <para>to where he stood hid behind the curtain.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action</para>
  <para>without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the</para>
  <para>instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune</para>
  <para>this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it</para>
  <para>right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened</para>
  <para>the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,</para>
  <para>where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George</para>
  <para>Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was</para>
  <para>a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the</para>
  <para>coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son</para>
  <para>struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something</para>
  <para>suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet</para>
  <para>in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your</para>
  <para>room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in</para>
  <para>the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you</para>
  <para>appeared upon the scene."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when</para>
  <para>he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not</para>
  <para>explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who</para>
  <para>certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He</para>
  <para>took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her</para>
  <para>secret."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the</para>
  <para>coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have</para>
  <para>been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!</para>
  <para>The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the</para>
  <para>scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went</para>
  <para>very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in</para>
  <para>the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since</para>
  <para>the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost</para>
  <para>to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but</para>
  <para>found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,</para>
  <para>however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood</para>
  <para>and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed</para>
  <para>that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been</para>
  <para>disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was</para>
  <para>shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had</para>
  <para>waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time</para>
  <para>that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had</para>
  <para>already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed</para>
  <para>round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,</para>
  <para>which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable</para>
  <para>lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in</para>
  <para>front of me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second</para>
  <para>double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked</para>
  <para>feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the</para>
  <para>latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the</para>
  <para>other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over</para>
  <para>the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed</para>
  <para>after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the</para>
  <para>hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while</para>
  <para>waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred</para>
  <para>yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,</para>
  <para>where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,</para>
  <para>and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me</para>
  <para>that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and</para>
  <para>another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been</para>
  <para>hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that</para>
  <para>the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the</para>
  <para>sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could</para>
  <para>at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the</para>
  <para>outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming</para>
  <para>in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what</para>
  <para>had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had</para>
  <para>brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had</para>
  <para>pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged</para>
  <para>at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which</para>
  <para>neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the</para>
  <para>prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So</para>
  <para>far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who</para>
  <para>was it brought him the coronet?</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the</para>
  <para>impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the</para>
  <para>truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,</para>
  <para>so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were</para>
  <para>the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in</para>
  <para>their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his</para>
  <para>cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should</para>
  <para>retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful</para>
  <para>one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and</para>
  <para>how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture</para>
  <para>became a certainty.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,</para>
  <para>for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must</para>
  <para>feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your</para>
  <para>circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir</para>
  <para>George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil</para>
  <para>reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots</para>
  <para>and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur</para>
  <para>had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was</para>
  <para>safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his</para>
  <para>own family.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took</para>
  <para>next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,</para>
  <para>managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that</para>
  <para>his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at</para>
  <para>the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of</para>
  <para>his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and</para>
  <para>saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"</para>
  <para>said Mr. Holder.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home</para>
  <para>and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to</para>
  <para>play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert</para>
  <para>scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our</para>
  <para>hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of</para>
  <para>course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every</para>
  <para>particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a</para>
  <para>life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I</para>
  <para>clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he</para>
  <para>became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give</para>
  <para>him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That</para>
  <para>brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,</para>
  <para>dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the</para>
  <para>three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had</para>
  <para>them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I</para>
  <para>set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000</para>
  <para>pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all</para>
  <para>was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after</para>
  <para>what I may call a really hard day's work."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said</para>
  <para>the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but</para>
  <para>you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your</para>
  <para>skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I</para>
  <para>must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I</para>
  <para>have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my</para>
  <para>very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is</para>
  <para>wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that</para>
  <para>whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than</para>
  <para>sufficient punishment."</para>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para/>
  <para>XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock</para>
  <para>Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily</para>
  <para>Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest</para>
  <para>manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is</para>
  <para>pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped</para>
  <para>this truth that in these little records of our cases which you</para>
  <para>have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,</para>
  <para>occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much</para>
  <para>to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I</para>
  <para>have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been</para>
  <para>trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those</para>
  <para>faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made</para>
  <para>my special province."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved</para>
  <para>from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my</para>
  <para>records."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing</para>
  <para>cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood</para>
  <para>pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a</para>
  <para>disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred</para>
  <para>perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your</para>
  <para>statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing</para>
  <para>upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is</para>
  <para>really the only notable feature about the thing."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,"</para>
  <para>I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism</para>
  <para>which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my</para>
  <para>friend's singular character.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as</para>
  <para>was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full</para>
  <para>justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a</para>
  <para>thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it</para>
  <para>is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should</para>
  <para>dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of</para>
  <para>lectures into a series of tales."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after</para>
  <para>breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at</para>
  <para>Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of</para>
  <para>dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,</para>
  <para>shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit</para>
  <para>and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for</para>
  <para>the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been</para>
  <para>silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the</para>
  <para>advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,</para>
  <para>having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very</para>
  <para>sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he</para>
  <para>had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,</para>
  <para>"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of</para>
  <para>these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself</para>
  <para>in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,</para>
  <para>at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King</para>
  <para>of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the</para>
  <para>problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the</para>
  <para>incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are</para>
  <para>outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I</para>
  <para>fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold</para>
  <para>to have been novel and of interest."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant</para>
  <para>public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a</para>
  <para>compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of</para>
  <para>analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot</para>
  <para>blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at</para>
  <para>least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As</para>
  <para>to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an</para>
  <para>agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to</para>
  <para>young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched</para>
  <para>bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my</para>
  <para>zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across</para>
  <para>to me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and</para>
  <para>ran thus:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether</para>
  <para>I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered</para>
  <para>to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I</para>
  <para>do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,</para>
  <para>                                               "VIOLET HUNTER."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Not I."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is half-past ten now."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You</para>
  <para>remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to</para>
  <para>be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.</para>
  <para>It may be so in this case, also."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,</para>
  <para>for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.</para>
  <para>She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,</para>
  <para>freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a</para>
  <para>woman who has had her own way to make in the world.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my</para>
  <para>companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange</para>
  <para>experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort</para>
  <para>from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be</para>
  <para>kind enough to tell me what I should do."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything</para>
  <para>that I can to serve you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner</para>
  <para>and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching</para>
  <para>fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and</para>
  <para>his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the</para>
  <para>family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel</para>
  <para>received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his</para>
  <para>children over to America with him, so that I found myself without</para>
  <para>a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but</para>
  <para>without success. At last the little money which I had saved began</para>
  <para>to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End</para>
  <para>called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in</para>
  <para>order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.</para>
  <para>Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is</para>
  <para>really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,</para>
  <para>and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,</para>
  <para>and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers</para>
  <para>and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office</para>
  <para>as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A</para>
  <para>prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy</para>
  <para>chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at</para>
  <para>her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very</para>
  <para>earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a</para>
  <para>jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.</para>
  <para>Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his</para>
  <para>hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a</para>
  <para>comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at</para>
  <para>him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, sir.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'As governess?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Yes, sir.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And what salary do you ask?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence</para>
  <para>Munro.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his</para>
  <para>fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling</para>
  <para>passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with</para>
  <para>such attractions and accomplishments?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I.</para>
  <para>'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.</para>
  <para>The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment</para>
  <para>of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are</para>
  <para>not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a</para>
  <para>considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have</para>
  <para>why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to</para>
  <para>accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,</para>
  <para>madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,</para>
  <para>such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,</para>
  <para>however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,</para>
  <para>opened a pocket-book and took out a note.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant</para>
  <para>fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid</para>
  <para>the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies</para>
  <para>half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little</para>
  <para>expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so</para>
  <para>thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the</para>
  <para>advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something</para>
  <para>unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know</para>
  <para>a little more before I quite committed myself.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles</para>
  <para>on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my</para>
  <para>dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would</para>
  <para>be.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if</para>
  <para>you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!</para>
  <para>smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back</para>
  <para>in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement,</para>
  <para>but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was</para>
  <para>joking.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single</para>
  <para>child?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he</para>
  <para>cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would</para>
  <para>suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided</para>
  <para>always that they were such commands as a lady might with</para>
  <para>propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I should be happy to make myself useful.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you</para>
  <para>know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress</para>
  <para>which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.</para>
  <para>Heh?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to</para>
  <para>you?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, no.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,</para>
  <para>my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of</para>
  <para>chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of</para>
  <para>sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been</para>
  <para>watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a</para>
  <para>shadow pass over his face as I spoke.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a</para>
  <para>little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,</para>
  <para>ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your</para>
  <para>hair?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a</para>
  <para>pity, because in other respects you would really have done very</para>
  <para>nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more</para>
  <para>of your young ladies.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers</para>
  <para>without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so</para>
  <para>much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting</para>
  <para>that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'If you please, Miss Stoper.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the</para>
  <para>most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You</para>
  <para>can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such</para>
  <para>opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong</para>
  <para>upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found</para>
  <para>little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the</para>
  <para>table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very</para>
  <para>foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and</para>
  <para>expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were</para>
  <para>at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few</para>
  <para>governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,</para>
  <para>what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing</para>
  <para>it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was</para>
  <para>inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after</para>
  <para>I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go</para>
  <para>back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open</para>
  <para>when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it</para>
  <para>here and I will read it to you:</para>
  <para/>
  <para>                       "'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.</para>
  <para>"'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your</para>
  <para>address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have</para>
  <para>reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you</para>
  <para>should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of</para>
  <para>you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a</para>
  <para>year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which</para>
  <para>our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My</para>
  <para>wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would</para>
  <para>like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need</para>
  <para>not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one</para>
  <para>belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which</para>
  <para>would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting</para>
  <para>here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that</para>
  <para>need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no</para>
  <para>doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty</para>
  <para>during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain</para>
  <para>firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary</para>
  <para>may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child</para>
  <para>is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall</para>
  <para>meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.</para>
  <para>Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and</para>
  <para>my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,</para>
  <para>that before taking the final step I should like to submit the</para>
  <para>whole matter to your consideration."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the</para>
  <para>question," said Holmes, smiling.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But you would not advise me to refuse?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to</para>
  <para>see a sister of mine apply for."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself</para>
  <para>formed some opinion?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.</para>
  <para>Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not</para>
  <para>possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the</para>
  <para>matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that</para>
  <para>he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an</para>
  <para>outbreak?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is</para>
  <para>the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a</para>
  <para>nice household for a young lady."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what</para>
  <para>makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when</para>
  <para>they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some</para>
  <para>strong reason behind."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would</para>
  <para>understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so</para>
  <para>much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that</para>
  <para>your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has</para>
  <para>come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel</para>
  <para>about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt</para>
  <para>or in danger--"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if</para>
  <para>we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a</para>
  <para>telegram would bring me down to your help."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the</para>
  <para>anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire</para>
  <para>quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,</para>
  <para>sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester</para>
  <para>to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both</para>
  <para>good-night and bustled off upon her way.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending</para>
  <para>the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able</para>
  <para>to take care of herself."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much</para>
  <para>mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled.</para>
  <para>A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts</para>
  <para>turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of</para>
  <para>human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual</para>
  <para>salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to</para>
  <para>something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether</para>
  <para>the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond</para>
  <para>my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat</para>
  <para>frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an</para>
  <para>abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his</para>
  <para>hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried</para>
  <para>impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would</para>
  <para>always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever</para>
  <para>have accepted such a situation.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The telegram which we eventually received came late one night</para>
  <para>just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down</para>
  <para>to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently</para>
  <para>indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a</para>
  <para>test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came</para>
  <para>down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,</para>
  <para>and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back</para>
  <para>to his chemical studies.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The summons was a brief and urgent one.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday</para>
  <para>to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I should wish to."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Just look it up, then."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my</para>
  <para>Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my</para>
  <para>analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the</para>
  <para>morning."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the</para>
  <para>old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers</para>
  <para>all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he</para>
  <para>threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal</para>
  <para>spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white</para>
  <para>clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining</para>
  <para>very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,</para>
  <para>which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,</para>
  <para>away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and</para>
  <para>grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light</para>
  <para>green of the new foliage.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the</para>
  <para>enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>But Holmes shook his head gravely.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of</para>
  <para>a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with</para>
  <para>reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered</para>
  <para>houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,</para>
  <para>and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their</para>
  <para>isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed</para>
  <para>there."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these</para>
  <para>dear old homesteads?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,</para>
  <para>Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest</para>
  <para>alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin</para>
  <para>than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You horrify me!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion</para>
  <para>can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no</para>
  <para>lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of</para>
  <para>a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among</para>
  <para>the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever</para>
  <para>so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is</para>
  <para>but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these</para>
  <para>lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part</para>
  <para>with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the</para>
  <para>deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,</para>
  <para>year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this</para>
  <para>lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I</para>
  <para>should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of</para>
  <para>country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is</para>
  <para>not personally threatened."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Quite so. She has her freedom."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would</para>
  <para>cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is</para>
  <para>correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we</para>
  <para>shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of</para>
  <para>the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has</para>
  <para>to tell."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no</para>
  <para>distance from the station, and there we found the young lady</para>
  <para>waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch</para>
  <para>awaited us upon the table.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It</para>
  <para>is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I</para>
  <para>should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray tell us what has happened to you."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.</para>
  <para>Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into</para>
  <para>town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long</para>
  <para>thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,</para>
  <para>with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is</para>
  <para>only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and</para>
  <para>I am not easy in my mind about them."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What can you not understand?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just</para>
  <para>as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and</para>
  <para>drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he</para>
  <para>said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,</para>
  <para>for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all</para>
  <para>stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds</para>
  <para>round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which</para>
  <para>slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about</para>
  <para>a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs</para>
  <para>to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord</para>
  <para>Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in</para>
  <para>front of the hall door has given its name to the place.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,</para>
  <para>and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.</para>
  <para>There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to</para>
  <para>us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is</para>
  <para>not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much</para>
  <para>younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,</para>
  <para>while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their</para>
  <para>conversation I have gathered that they have been married about</para>
  <para>seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by</para>
  <para>the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.</para>
  <para>Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them</para>
  <para>was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As</para>
  <para>the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite</para>
  <para>imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her</para>
  <para>father's young wife.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as</para>
  <para>in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.</para>
  <para>She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately</para>
  <para>devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey</para>
  <para>eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every</para>
  <para>little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her</para>
  <para>also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they</para>
  <para>seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,</para>
  <para>this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the</para>
  <para>saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her</para>
  <para>in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of</para>
  <para>her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so</para>
  <para>utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small</para>
  <para>for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.</para>
  <para>His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between</para>
  <para>savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving</para>
  <para>pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea</para>
  <para>of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning</para>
  <para>the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would</para>
  <para>rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he</para>
  <para>has little to do with my story."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they</para>
  <para>seem to you to be relevant or not."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one</para>
  <para>unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was</para>
  <para>the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a</para>
  <para>man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,</para>
  <para>uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual</para>
  <para>smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been</para>
  <para>quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.</para>
  <para>His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as</para>
  <para>silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most</para>
  <para>unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the</para>
  <para>nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one</para>
  <para>corner of the building.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was</para>
  <para>very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after</para>
  <para>breakfast and whispered something to her husband.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to</para>
  <para>you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut</para>
  <para>your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest</para>
  <para>iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue</para>
  <para>dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in</para>
  <para>your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should</para>
  <para>both be extremely obliged.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade</para>
  <para>of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it</para>
  <para>bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not</para>
  <para>have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.</para>
  <para>and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which</para>
  <para>seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for</para>
  <para>me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching</para>
  <para>along the entire front of the house, with three long windows</para>
  <para>reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the</para>
  <para>central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was</para>
  <para>asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the</para>
  <para>other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest</para>
  <para>stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how</para>
  <para>comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.</para>
  <para>Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so</para>
  <para>much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,</para>
  <para>anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle</para>
  <para>suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the</para>
  <para>day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in</para>
  <para>the nursery.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Two days later this same performance was gone through under</para>
  <para>exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I</para>
  <para>sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny</para>
  <para>stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which</para>
  <para>he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and</para>
  <para>moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not</para>
  <para>fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for</para>
  <para>about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then</para>
  <para>suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and</para>
  <para>to change my dress.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to</para>
  <para>what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly</para>
  <para>be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face</para>
  <para>away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire</para>
  <para>to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be</para>
  <para>impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been</para>
  <para>broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of</para>
  <para>the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst</para>
  <para>of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able</para>
  <para>with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I</para>
  <para>confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that</para>
  <para>was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I</para>
  <para>perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,</para>
  <para>a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in</para>
  <para>my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are</para>
  <para>usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the</para>
  <para>railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I</para>
  <para>lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her</para>
  <para>eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,</para>
  <para>but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my</para>
  <para>hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the</para>
  <para>road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, I know no one in these parts.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to</para>
  <para>him to go away.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn</para>
  <para>round and wave him away like that.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew</para>
  <para>down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have</para>
  <para>not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor</para>
  <para>seen the man in the road."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a</para>
  <para>most interesting one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may</para>
  <para>prove to be little relation between the different incidents of</para>
  <para>which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper</para>
  <para>Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands</para>
  <para>near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp</para>
  <para>rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving</para>
  <para>about.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two</para>
  <para>planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a</para>
  <para>vague figure huddled up in the darkness.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start</para>
  <para>which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,</para>
  <para>but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do</para>
  <para>anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,</para>
  <para>so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose</para>
  <para>every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs</para>
  <para>upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your</para>
  <para>foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life</para>
  <para>is worth.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to</para>
  <para>look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.</para>
  <para>It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the</para>
  <para>house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was</para>
  <para>standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was</para>
  <para>aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper</para>
  <para>beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It</para>
  <para>was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging</para>
  <para>jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly</para>
  <para>across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.</para>
  <para>That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not</para>
  <para>think that any burglar could have done.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as</para>
  <para>you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a</para>
  <para>great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the</para>
  <para>child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the</para>
  <para>furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.</para>
  <para>There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones</para>
  <para>empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two</para>
  <para>with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was</para>
  <para>naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It</para>
  <para>struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,</para>
  <para>so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very</para>
  <para>first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There</para>
  <para>was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never</para>
  <para>guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,</para>
  <para>and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing</para>
  <para>obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in</para>
  <para>the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the</para>
  <para>contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two</para>
  <para>tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was</para>
  <para>it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at</para>
  <para>all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,</para>
  <para>and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that</para>
  <para>I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had</para>
  <para>locked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,</para>
  <para>and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.</para>
  <para>There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited</para>
  <para>at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of</para>
  <para>the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.</para>
  <para>One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle</para>
  <para>coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on</para>
  <para>his face which made him a very different person to the round,</para>
  <para>jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his</para>
  <para>brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his</para>
  <para>temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me</para>
  <para>without a word or a look.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the</para>
  <para>grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I</para>
  <para>could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four</para>
  <para>of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the</para>
  <para>fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I</para>
  <para>strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle</para>
  <para>came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you</para>
  <para>without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with</para>
  <para>business matters.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,</para>
  <para>'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one</para>
  <para>of them has the shutters up.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled</para>
  <para>at my remark.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my</para>
  <para>dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we</para>
  <para>have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever</para>
  <para>believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest</para>
  <para>in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and</para>
  <para>annoyance, but no jest.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there</para>
  <para>was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,</para>
  <para>I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,</para>
  <para>though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a</para>
  <para>feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this</para>
  <para>place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's</para>
  <para>instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,</para>
  <para>and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the</para>
  <para>forbidden door.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,</para>
  <para>besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to</para>
  <para>do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large</para>
  <para>black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been</para>
  <para>drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when</para>
  <para>I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at</para>
  <para>all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both</para>
  <para>downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an</para>
  <para>admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,</para>
  <para>opened the door, and slipped through.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and</para>
  <para>uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.</para>
  <para>Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third</para>
  <para>of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and</para>
  <para>cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so</para>
  <para>thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through</para>
  <para>them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it</para>
  <para>had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked</para>
  <para>at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with</para>
  <para>stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was</para>
  <para>not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the</para>
  <para>shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from</para>
  <para>beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was</para>
  <para>a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the</para>
  <para>passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it</para>
  <para>might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room</para>
  <para>and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little</para>
  <para>slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,</para>
  <para>unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My</para>
  <para>overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran</para>
  <para>as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the</para>
  <para>skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,</para>
  <para>and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting</para>
  <para>outside.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it</para>
  <para>must be when I saw the door open.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how</para>
  <para>caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened</para>
  <para>you, my dear young lady?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I</para>
  <para>was keenly on my guard against him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.</para>
  <para>'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was</para>
  <para>frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in</para>
  <para>there!'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Why, what did you think?' I asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Why do you think that I lock this door?'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I am sure that I do not know.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you</para>
  <para>see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'I am sure if I had known--'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over</para>
  <para>that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into</para>
  <para>a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a</para>
  <para>demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that</para>
  <para>I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing</para>
  <para>until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I</para>
  <para>thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without</para>
  <para>some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the</para>
  <para>woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible</para>
  <para>to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of</para>
  <para>course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was</para>
  <para>almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would</para>
  <para>send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the</para>
  <para>office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then</para>
  <para>returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my</para>
  <para>mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I</para>
  <para>remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of</para>
  <para>insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one</para>
  <para>in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,</para>
  <para>or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and</para>
  <para>lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.</para>
  <para>I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this</para>
  <para>morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and</para>
  <para>Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the</para>
  <para>evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you</para>
  <para>all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you</para>
  <para>could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should</para>
  <para>do."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.</para>
  <para>My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in</para>
  <para>his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon</para>
  <para>his face.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do</para>
  <para>nothing with him."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, the wine-cellar."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very</para>
  <para>brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could</para>
  <para>perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not</para>
  <para>think you a quite exceptional woman."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will try. What is it?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend</para>
  <para>and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,</para>
  <para>we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might</para>
  <para>give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some</para>
  <para>errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate</para>
  <para>matters immensely."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will do it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of</para>
  <para>course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been</para>
  <para>brought there to personate someone, and the real person is</para>
  <para>imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this</para>
  <para>prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice</para>
  <para>Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to</para>
  <para>America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,</para>
  <para>figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very</para>
  <para>possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of</para>
  <para>course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you</para>
  <para>came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some</para>
  <para>friend of hers--possibly her fiancé--and no doubt, as you wore</para>
  <para>the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your</para>
  <para>laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,</para>
  <para>that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer</para>
  <para>desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent</para>
  <para>him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly</para>
  <para>clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of</para>
  <para>the child."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining</para>
  <para>light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the</para>
  <para>parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have</para>
  <para>frequently gained my first real insight into the character of</para>
  <para>parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is</para>
  <para>abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he</para>
  <para>derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or</para>
  <para>from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their</para>
  <para>power."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A</para>
  <para>thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you</para>
  <para>have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to</para>
  <para>this poor creature."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning</para>
  <para>man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall</para>
  <para>be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the</para>
  <para>mystery."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we</para>
  <para>reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside</para>
  <para>public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining</para>
  <para>like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were</para>
  <para>sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been</para>
  <para>standing smiling on the door-step.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is</para>
  <para>Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring</para>
  <para>on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates</para>
  <para>of Mr. Rucastle's."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now</para>
  <para>lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black</para>
  <para>business."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a</para>
  <para>passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss</para>
  <para>Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the</para>
  <para>transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but</para>
  <para>without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence</para>
  <para>Holmes' face clouded over.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss</para>
  <para>Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put</para>
  <para>your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our</para>
  <para>way in."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united</para>
  <para>strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There</para>
  <para>was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a</para>
  <para>basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner</para>
  <para>gone.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty</para>
  <para>has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim</para>
  <para>off."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But how?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He</para>
  <para>swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the</para>
  <para>end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did</para>
  <para>it."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not</para>
  <para>there when the Rucastles went away."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and</para>
  <para>dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were</para>
  <para>he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it</para>
  <para>would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at</para>
  <para>the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy</para>
  <para>stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the</para>
  <para>wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and</para>
  <para>confronted him.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open</para>
  <para>skylight.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies</para>
  <para>and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll</para>
  <para>serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he</para>
  <para>could go.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I have my revolver," said I.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed</para>
  <para>down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we</para>
  <para>heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a</para>
  <para>horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An</para>
  <para>elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out</para>
  <para>at a side door.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been</para>
  <para>fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with</para>
  <para>Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its</para>
  <para>black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and</para>
  <para>screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and</para>
  <para>it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great</para>
  <para>creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and</para>
  <para>carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid</para>
  <para>him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered</para>
  <para>Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to</para>
  <para>relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door</para>
  <para>opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he</para>
  <para>went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know</para>
  <para>what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains</para>
  <para>were wasted."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.</para>
  <para>Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several</para>
  <para>points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done</para>
  <para>so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's</para>
  <para>police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the</para>
  <para>one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend</para>
  <para>too.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time</para>
  <para>that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no</para>
  <para>say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until</para>
  <para>after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could</para>
  <para>learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so</para>
  <para>quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them</para>
  <para>but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was</para>
  <para>safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming</para>
  <para>forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then</para>
  <para>her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to</para>
  <para>sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use</para>
  <para>her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until</para>
  <para>she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then</para>
  <para>she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her</para>
  <para>beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her</para>
  <para>young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough</para>
  <para>to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce</para>
  <para>all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this</para>
  <para>system of imprisonment?"</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Yes, sir."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of</para>
  <para>the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"That was it, sir."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should</para>
  <para>be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain</para>
  <para>arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your</para>
  <para>interests were the same as his."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said</para>
  <para>Mrs. Toller serenely.</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no</para>
  <para>want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment</para>
  <para>when your master had gone out."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"You have it, sir, just as it happened."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for</para>
  <para>you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And</para>
  <para>here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,</para>
  <para>Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,</para>
  <para>as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a</para>
  <para>questionable one."</para>
  <para/>
  <para>And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the</para>
  <para>copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but</para>
  <para>was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of</para>
  <para>his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who</para>
  <para>probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it</para>
  <para>difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were</para>
  <para>married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their</para>
  <para>flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in</para>
  <para>the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend</para>
  <para>Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further</para>
  <para>interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one</para>
  <para>of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at</para>
  <para>Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.</para>
