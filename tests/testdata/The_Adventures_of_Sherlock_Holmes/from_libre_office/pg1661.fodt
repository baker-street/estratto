   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">veil from men&apos;s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">memory.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my former friend and companion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>had formerly been in part my own.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">introspective fashion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Wedlock suits you,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I think, Watson, that you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Seven!&quot; I answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tell me that you intended to go into harness.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, how do you know?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">careless servant girl?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear Holmes,&quot; said I, &quot;this is too much. You would certainly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can&apos;t imagine how you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">together.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is simplicity itself,&quot; said he; &quot;my eyes tell me that on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him to be an active member of the medical profession.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">process of deduction. &quot;When I hear you give your reasons,&quot; I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked, &quot;the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as yours.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so,&quot; he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself down into an armchair. &quot;You see, but you do not observe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Frequently.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How often?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, some hundreds of times.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then how many are there?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How many? I don&apos;t know.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interested in these little problems, and since you are good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may be interested in this.&quot; He threw over a sheet of thick,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It came by the last post,&quot; said he. &quot;Read it aloud.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">o&apos;clock,&quot; it said, &quot;a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This is indeed a mystery,&quot; I remarked. &quot;What do you imagine that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it means?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What do you deduce from it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">written.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,&quot; I remarked,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">endeavouring to imitate my companion&apos;s processes. &quot;Such paper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strong and stiff.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Peculiar--that is the very word,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It is not an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I did so, and saw a large &quot;E&quot; with a small &quot;g,&quot; a &quot;P,&quot; and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">large &quot;G&quot; with a small &quot;t&quot; woven into the texture of the paper.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What do you make of that?&quot; asked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Not at all. The &apos;G&apos; with the small &apos;t&apos; stands for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Gesellschaft,&apos; which is the German for &apos;Company.&apos; It is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">customary contraction like our &apos;Co.&apos; &apos;P,&apos; of course, stands for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Papier.&apos; Now for the &apos;Eg.&apos; Let us glance at our Continental</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Gazetteer.&quot; He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. &apos;Remarkable as being</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glass-factories and paper-mills.&apos; Ha, ha, my boy, what do you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">make of that?&quot; His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The paper was made in Bohemia,&quot; I said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">note the peculiar construction of the sentence--&apos;This account of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you we have from all quarters received.&apos; A Frenchman or Russian</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could not have written that. It is the German who is so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses&apos; hoofs and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bell. Holmes whistled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A pair, by the sound,&quot; said he. &quot;Yes,&quot; he continued, glancing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out of the window. &quot;A nice little brougham and a pair of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There&apos;s money in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that I had better go, Holmes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to miss it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But your client--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attention.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a loud and authoritative tap.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Come in!&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You had my note?&quot; he asked with a deep harsh voice and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strongly marked German accent. &quot;I told you that I would call.&quot; He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">address.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray take a seat,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;This is my friend and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with you alone.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back into my chair. &quot;It is both, or none,&quot; said he. &quot;You may say</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. &quot;Then I must begin,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he, &quot;by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may have an influence upon European history.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I promise,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And I.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will excuse this mask,&quot; continued our strange visitor. &quot;The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">just called myself is not exactly my own.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was aware of it,&quot; said Holmes dryly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was also aware of that,&quot; murmured Holmes, settling himself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down in his armchair and closing his eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>gigantic client.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked, &quot;I should be better able to advise you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. &quot;You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are right,&quot; he cried; &quot;I am the King. Why should I attempt to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conceal it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why, indeed?&quot; murmured Holmes. &quot;Your Majesty had not spoken</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hereditary King of Bohemia.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you can understand,&quot; said our strange visitor, sitting down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, &quot;you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, pray consult,&quot; said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,&quot; murmured Holmes without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fishes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Let me see!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is now desirous of getting those letters back.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely so. But how--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Was there a secret marriage?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No legal papers or certificates?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she to prove their authenticity?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is the writing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pooh, pooh! Forgery.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My private note-paper.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Stolen.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My own seal.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Imitated.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My photograph.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Bought.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We were both in the photograph.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">indiscretion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was mad--insane.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have compromised yourself seriously.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It must be recovered.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We have tried and failed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She will not sell.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Stolen, then.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she has been waylaid. There has been no result.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No sign of it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Absolutely none.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes laughed. &quot;It is quite a pretty little problem,&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But a very serious one to me,&quot; returned the King reproachfully.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To ruin me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But how?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am about to be married.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;So I have heard.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And Irene Adler?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go--none.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are sure that she has not sent it yet?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am sure.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And why?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, then we have three days yet,&quot; said Holmes with a yawn. &quot;That</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">London for the present?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Count Von Kramm.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, as to money?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have carte blanche.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Absolutely?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to have that photograph.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And for present expenses?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and laid it on the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">notes,&quot; he said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">handed it to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And Mademoiselle&apos;s address?&quot; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John&apos;s Wood.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes took a note of it. &quot;One other question,&quot; said he. &quot;Was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph a cabinet?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,&quot; he added,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. &quot;If</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">o&apos;clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">II.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">At three o&apos;clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house shortly after eight o&apos;clock in the morning. I sat down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strange features which were associated with the two crimes which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enter into my head.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was close upon four before the door opened, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Accustomed as I was to my friend&apos;s amazing powers in the use of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, really!&quot; he cried, and then he choked and laughed again</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What is it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I can&apos;t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however. I left the house a little after eight o&apos;clock this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">noting anything else of interest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And what of Irene Adler?&quot; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, she has turned all the men&apos;s heads down in that part. She is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of campaign.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relation between them, and what the object of his repeated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman&apos;s chambers in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">situation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am following you closely,&quot; I answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at home.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his pocket and looked at it earnestly, &apos;Drive like the devil,&apos; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shouted, &apos;first to Gross &amp; Hankey&apos;s in Regent Street, and then to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you do it in twenty minutes!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the buckles. It hadn&apos;t pulled up before she shot out of the hall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The Church of St. Monica, John,&apos; she cried, &apos;and half a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">object. &apos;The Church of St. Monica,&apos; said I, &apos;and half a sovereign</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if you reach it in twenty minutes.&apos; It was twenty-five minutes to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My cabby drove fast. I don&apos;t think I ever drove faster, but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Thank God,&apos; he cried. &apos;You&apos;ll do. Come! Come!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What then?&apos; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won&apos;t be legal.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">now. It seems that there had been some informality about their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,&quot; said I; &quot;and what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she to her own house. &apos;I shall drive out in the park at five as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">usual,&apos; she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away in different directions, and I went off to make my own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrangements.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Which are?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Some cold beef and a glass of beer,&quot; he answered, ringing the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bell. &quot;I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your co-operation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall be delighted.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You don&apos;t mind breaking the law?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not in the least.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nor running a chance of arrest?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not in a good cause.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, the cause is excellent!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I am your man.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was sure that I might rely on you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But what is it you wish?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you. Now,&quot; he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our landlady had provided, &quot;I must discuss it while I eat, for I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And what then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not interfere, come what may. You understand?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am to be neutral?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to that open window.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fire. You quite follow me?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Entirely.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is nothing very formidable,&quot; he said, taking a long cigar-shaped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">roll from his pocket. &quot;It is an ordinary plumber&apos;s smoke-rocket,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then you may entirely rely on me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prepare for the new role I have to play.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crime.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes&apos; succinct description,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cigars in their mouths.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You see,&quot; remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the house, &quot;this marriage rather simplifies matters. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where, indeed?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But it has twice been burgled.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pshaw! They did not know how to look.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But how will you look?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will not look.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will get her to show me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But she will refuse.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back into the street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Is the poor gentleman much hurt?&quot; she asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He is dead,&quot; cried several voices.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no, there&apos;s life in him!&quot; shouted another. &quot;But he&apos;ll be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gone before you can get him to hospital.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He&apos;s a brave fellow,&quot; said a woman. &quot;They would have had the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lady&apos;s purse and watch if it hadn&apos;t been for him. They were a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he&apos;s breathing now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He can&apos;t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sofa. This way, please!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but preventing her from injuring another.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of &quot;Fire!&quot; The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of &quot;Fire!&quot; Thick clouds</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">friend&apos;s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Edgeware Road.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You did it very nicely, Doctor,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Nothing could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been better. It is all right.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have the photograph?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I know where it is.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And how did you find out?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She showed me, as I told you she would.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am still in the dark.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I do not wish to make a mystery,&quot; said he, laughing. &quot;The matter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I guessed as much.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That also I could fathom.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chance.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How did that help you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And now?&quot; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it with his own hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And when will you call?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the King without delay.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurried by.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I&apos;ve heard that voice before,&quot; said Holmes, staring down the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dimly lit street. &quot;Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">III.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have really got it!&quot; he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not yet.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you have hopes?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have hopes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We must have a cab.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, my brougham is waiting.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then that will simplify matters.&quot; We descended and started off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once more for Briony Lodge.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Irene Adler is married,&quot; remarked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Married! When?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yesterday.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But to whom?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To an English lawyer named Norton.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But she could not love him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am in hopes that she does.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And why in hopes?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">why she should interfere with your Majesty&apos;s plan.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">station! What a queen she would have made!&quot; He relapsed into a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Serpentine Avenue.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the brougham.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?&quot; said she.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am Mr. Holmes,&quot; answered my companion, looking at her with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">questioning and rather startled gaze.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Cross for the Continent.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What!&quot; Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surprise. &quot;Do you mean that she has left England?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Never to return.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And the papers?&quot; asked the King hoarsely. &quot;All is lost.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We shall see.&quot; He pushed past the servant and rushed into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.&quot; My friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>them, and came down just as you departed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">started for the Temple to see my husband.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="38"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">&quot;Very truly yours,</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="35"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">&quot;IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What a woman--oh, what a woman!&quot; cried the King of Bohemia, when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we had all three read this epistle. &quot;Did I not tell you how quick</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very different level to your Majesty,&quot; said Holmes coldly. &quot;I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty&apos;s business</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to a more successful conclusion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On the contrary, my dear sir,&quot; cried the King; &quot;nothing could be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reward you. This ring--&quot; He slipped an emerald snake ring from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your Majesty has something which I should value even more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">highly,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have but to name it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This photograph!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The King stared at him in amazement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Irene&apos;s photograph!&quot; he cried. &quot;Certainly, if you wish it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.&quot; He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chambers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>beaten by a woman&apos;s wit. He used to make merry over the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">behind me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson,&quot; he said cordially.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was afraid that you were engaged.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So I am. Very much so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I can wait in the next room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fat-encircled eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Try the settee,&quot; said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">judicial moods. &quot;I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little adventures.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,&quot; I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daring than any effort of the imagination.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">things are very often connected not with the larger but with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bore every mark of being an average commonplace British</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shepherd&apos;s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">discontent upon his features.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes&apos; quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes?&quot; he asked. &quot;How did you know, for example, that I did</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">manual labour. It&apos;s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carpenter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">developed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I won&apos;t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">use an arc-and-compass breastpin.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">elbow where you rest it upon the desk?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, but China?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes&apos; scales of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">becomes even more simple.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. &quot;Well, I never!&quot; said he. &quot;I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that there was nothing in it, after all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I begin to think, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;that I make a mistake</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in explaining. &apos;Omne ignotum pro magnifico,&apos; you know, and my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, I have got it now,&quot; he answered with his thick red finger</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">planted halfway down the column. &quot;Here it is. This is what began</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I took the paper from him and read as follows:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eleven o&apos;clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Pope&apos;s Court, Fleet Street.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What on earth does this mean?&quot; I ejaculated after I had twice</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">read over the extraordinary announcement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in high spirits. &quot;It is a little off the beaten track, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he. &quot;And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Doctor, of the paper and the date.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ago.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>Holmes,&quot; said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; &quot;I have a small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pawnbroker&apos;s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It&apos;s not a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What is the name of this obliging youth?&quot; asked Sherlock Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he&apos;s not such a youth,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">either. It&apos;s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">among employers in this age. I don&apos;t know that your assistant is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not as remarkable as your advertisement.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, he has his faults, too,&quot; said Mr. Wilson. &quot;Never was such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">main fault, but on the whole he&apos;s a good worker. There&apos;s no vice</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He is still with you, I presume?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cooking and keeps the place clean--that&apos;s all I have in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Why that?&apos; I asks.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Why,&apos; says he, &apos;here&apos;s another vacancy on the League of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Red-headed Men. It&apos;s worth quite a little fortune to any man who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits&apos; end what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Why, what is it, then?&apos; I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn&apos;t know much of what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?&apos; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">asked with his eyes open.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Never.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the vacancies.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And what are they worth?&apos; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and it need not interfere very much with one&apos;s other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occupations.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Tell me all about it,&apos; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well,&apos; said he, showing me the advertisement, &apos;you can see for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;But,&apos; said I, &apos;there would be millions of red-headed men who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would apply.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Not so many as you might think,&apos; he answered. &apos;You see it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">few hundred pounds.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the address that was given us in the advertisement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope&apos;s Court</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">looked like a coster&apos;s orange barrow. I should not have thought</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there were so many in the whole country as were brought together</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ourselves in the office.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your experience has been a most entertaining one,&quot; remarked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pinch of snuff. &quot;Pray continue your very interesting statement.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might have a private word with us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,&apos; said my assistant, &apos;and he is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">willing to fill a vacancy in the League.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And he is admirably suited for it,&apos; the other answered. &apos;He has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fine.&apos; He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">success.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It would be injustice to hesitate,&apos; said he. &apos;You will,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yelled with the pain. &apos;There is water in your eyes,&apos; said he as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he released me. &apos;I perceive that all is as it should be. But we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler&apos;s wax which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would disgust you with human nature.&apos; He stepped over to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">manager.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;My name,&apos; said he, &apos;is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I answered that I had not.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;His face fell immediately.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Dear me!&apos; he said gravely, &apos;that is very serious indeed! I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bachelor.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a few minutes he said that it would be all right.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;In the case of another,&apos; said he, &apos;the objection might be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">new duties?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!&apos; said Vincent Spaulding.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;I should be able to look after that for you.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What would be the hours?&apos; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Ten to two.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now a pawnbroker&apos;s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and that he would see to anything that turned up.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;That would suit me very well,&apos; said I. &apos;And the pay?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Is 4 pounds a week.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And the work?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Is purely nominal.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What do you call purely nominal?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">don&apos;t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">during that time.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It&apos;s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No excuse will avail,&apos; said Mr. Duncan Ross; &apos;neither sickness</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your billet.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And the work?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Is to copy out the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica.&quot; There is the first</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ready to-morrow?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Certainly,&apos; I answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once more on the important position which you have been fortunate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enough to gain.&apos; He bowed me out of the room and I went home with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at my own good fortune.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Encyclopaedia Britannica.&apos; Vincent Spaulding did what he could to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Pope&apos;s Court.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o&apos;clock he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">written, and locked the door of the office after me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">week&apos;s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the loss of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B&apos;s before very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business came to an end.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To an end?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">usual at ten o&apos;clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of note-paper. It read in this fashion:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="18"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="27"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">IS</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="24"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">DISSOLVED.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="21"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">October 9, 1890.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">completely overtopped every other consideration that we both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">burst out into a roar of laughter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot see that there is anything very funny,&quot; cried our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. &quot;If you can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no,&quot; cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which he had half risen. &quot;I really wouldn&apos;t miss your case for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">door?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well,&apos; said I, &apos;the gentleman at No. 4.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What, the red-headed man?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh,&apos; said he, &apos;his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Where could I find him?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">King Edward Street, near St. Paul&apos;s.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And what did you do then?&quot; asked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you did very wisely,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Your case is an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">From what you have told me I think that it is possible that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Grave enough!&quot; said Mr. Jabez Wilson. &quot;Why, I have lost four</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pound a week.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;As far as you are personally concerned,&quot; remarked Holmes, &quot;I do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lost nothing by them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cost them two and thirty pounds.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been with you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;About a month then.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How did he come?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In answer to an advertisement.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Was he the only applicant?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I had a dozen.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why did you pick him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Because he was handy and would come cheap.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;At half-wages, in fact.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though he&apos;s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his forehead.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. &quot;I thought</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as much,&quot; said he. &quot;Have you ever observed that his ears are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pierced for earrings?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a lad.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Hum!&quot; said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. &quot;He is still</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And has your business been attended to in your absence?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nothing to complain of, sir. There&apos;s never very much to do of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, Watson,&quot; said Holmes when our visitor had left us, &quot;what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do you make of it all?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I make nothing of it,&quot; I answered frankly. &quot;It is a most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mysterious business.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;As a rule,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;the more bizarre a thing is the less</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What are you going to do, then?&quot; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To smoke,&quot; he answered. &quot;It is quite a three pipe problem, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beg that you won&apos;t speak to me for fifty minutes.&quot; He curled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Sarasate plays at the St. James&apos;s Hall this afternoon,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked. &quot;What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you for a few hours?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absorbing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;JABEZ WILSON&quot; in white letters, upon a corner house, announced</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he returned to the pawnbroker&apos;s, and, having thumped vigorously</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;I only wished to ask you how you would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go from here to the Strand.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Third right, fourth left,&quot; answered the assistant promptly,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">closing the door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Smart fellow, that,&quot; observed Holmes as we walked away. &quot;He is,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something of him before.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Evidently,&quot; said I, &quot;Mr. Wilson&apos;s assistant counts for a good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The knees of his trousers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And what did you see?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What I expected to see.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why did you beat the pavement?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are spies in an enemy&apos;s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of fine shops and stately business premises that they really</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which we had just quitted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Let me see,&quot; said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">along the line, &quot;I should like just to remember the order of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">London. There is Mortimer&apos;s, the tobacconist, the little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane&apos;s carriage-building</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Doctor, we&apos;ve done our work, so it&apos;s time we had some play. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James&apos;s Hall I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself to hunt down.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,&quot; he remarked as we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">emerged.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, it would be as well.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business at Coburg Square is serious.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why serious?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-night.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;At what time?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ten will be early enough.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall be at Baker Street at ten.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.&quot; He waved his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crowd.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">copier of the &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot; down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker&apos;s assistant was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">until night should bring an explanation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha! Our party is complete,&quot; said Holmes, buttoning up his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-night&apos;s adventure.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We&apos;re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,&quot; said Jones in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his consequential way. &quot;Our friend here is a wonderful man for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the running down.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the police agent loftily. &quot;He has his own little methods, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are, if he won&apos;t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">correct than the official force.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,&quot; said the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stranger with deference. &quot;Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have not had my rubber.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think you will find,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, &quot;that you will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He&apos;s a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>any criminal in London. He&apos;s a remarkable man, is young John</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">find the man himself. He&apos;ll crack a crib in Scotland one week,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I&apos;ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yet.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I&apos;ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">second.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We are close there now,&quot; my friend remarked. &quot;This fellow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are, and they are waiting for us.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round with crates and massive boxes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are not very vulnerable from above,&quot; Holmes remarked as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">held up the lantern and gazed about him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nor from below,&quot; said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the flags which lined the floor. &quot;Why, dear me, it sounds quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hollow!&quot; he remarked, looking up in surprise.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!&quot; said Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">severely. &quot;You have already imperilled the whole success of our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and put his glass in his pocket.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We have at least an hour before us,&quot; he remarked, &quot;for they can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">present.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is our French gold,&quot; whispered the director. &quot;We have had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your French gold?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">directors have had misgivings upon the subject.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Which were very well justified,&quot; observed Holmes. &quot;And now it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And sit in the dark?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rubber after all. But I see that the enemy&apos;s preparations have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">compunction about shooting them down.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to flash out at a moment&apos;s notice. To me, with my nerves worked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vault.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They have but one retreat,&quot; whispered Holmes. &quot;That is back</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">done what I asked you, Jones?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and wait.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of a light.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the stones.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a shock of very red hair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s all clear,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Have you the chisel and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I&apos;ll swing for it!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes&apos; hunting crop came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down on the man&apos;s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">floor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s no use, John Clay,&quot; said Holmes blandly. &quot;You have no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chance at all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So I see,&quot; the other answered with the utmost coolness. &quot;I fancy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coat-tails.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There are three men waiting for him at the door,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">must compliment you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;And I you,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;Your red-headed idea was very new</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and effective.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You&apos;ll see your pal again presently,&quot; said Jones. &quot;He&apos;s quicker</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">derbies.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the goodness, also, when you address me always to say &apos;sir&apos; and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;please.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;All right,&quot; said Jones with a stare and a snigger. &quot;Well, would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your Highness to the police-station?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is better,&quot; said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">detective.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Really, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the cellar, &quot;I do not know how the bank can thank you or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">John Clay,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I have been at some small expense over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Red-headed League.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You see, Watson,&quot; he explained in the early hours of the morning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, &quot;it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the League, and the copying of the &apos;Encyclopaedia,&apos; must be to get</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no doubt suggested to Clay&apos;s ingenious mind by the colour of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accomplice&apos;s hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for securing the situation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But how could you guess what the motive was?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man&apos;s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to some other building.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Suburban Bank abutted on our friend&apos;s premises, and felt that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">directors, with the result that you have seen.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And how could you tell that they would make their attempt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-night?&quot; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson&apos;s presence--in other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You reasoned it out beautifully,&quot; I exclaimed in unfeigned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">admiration. &quot;It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">true.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It saved me from ennui,&quot; he answered, yawning. &quot;Alas! I already</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">problems help me to do so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you are a benefactor of the race,&quot; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Well, perhaps, after all, it is of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some little use,&quot; he remarked. &quot;&apos;L&apos;homme c&apos;est rien--l&apos;oeuvre</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">c&apos;est tout,&apos; as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, &quot;life is infinitely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unprofitable.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And yet I am not convinced of it,&quot; I answered. &quot;The cases which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">neither fascinating nor artistic.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">realistic effect,&quot; remarked Holmes. &quot;This is wanting in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I smiled and shook my head. &quot;I can quite understand your thinking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so,&quot; I said. &quot;Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strange and bizarre. But here&quot;--I picked up the morning paper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the ground--&quot;let us put it to a practical test. Here is the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">first heading upon which I come. &apos;A husband&apos;s cruelty to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wife.&apos; There is half a column of print, but I know without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">writers could invent nothing more crude.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. &quot;This</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you in your example.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah,&quot; said he, &quot;I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And the ring?&quot; I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sparkled upon his finger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my little problems.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And have you any on hand just now?&quot; I asked with interest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interest. They are important, you understand, without being</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I may have something better before very many minutes are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clang of the bell.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have seen those symptoms before,&quot; said Holmes, throwing his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cigarette into the fire. &quot;Oscillation upon the pavement always</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">peculiar to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you not find,&quot; he said, &quot;that with your short sight it is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little trying to do so much typewriting?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I did at first,&quot; she answered, &quot;but now I know where the letters</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are without looking.&quot; Then, suddenly realising the full purport</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. &quot;You&apos;ve</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard about me, Mr. Holmes,&quot; she cried, &quot;else how could you know</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all that?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Never mind,&quot; said Holmes, laughing; &quot;it is my business to know</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">much for me. I&apos;m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?&quot; asked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the ceiling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mary Sutherland. &quot;Yes, I did bang out of the house,&quot; she said,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your father,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;your stepfather, surely, since the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">name is different.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And your mother is alive?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn&apos;t best pleased, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes, when she married again so soon after father&apos;s death, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn&apos;t</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your own little income,&quot; he asked, &quot;does it come out of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only touch the interest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You interest me extremely,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;And since you draw so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon an income of about 60 pounds.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">understand that as long as I live at home I don&apos;t wish to be a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have made your position very clear to me,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A flush stole over Miss Sutherland&apos;s face, and she picked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nervously at the fringe of her jacket. &quot;I met him first at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gasfitters&apos; ball,&quot; she said. &quot;They used to send father tickets</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">father&apos;s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;that when Mr. Windibank came back from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anything to a woman, for she would have her way.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see. Then at the gasfitters&apos; ball you met, as I understand, a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any more.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, you know father didn&apos;t like anything of the sort. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wouldn&apos;t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">begin with, and I had not got mine yet.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there was no need for father to know.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Leadenhall Street--and--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What office?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That&apos;s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where did he live, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He slept on the premises.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you don&apos;t know his address?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where did you address your letters, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn&apos;t</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was most suggestive,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It has long been an axiom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">voice was gentle. He&apos;d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">returned to France?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said she would make it all right with him. I didn&apos;t quite like</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he was only a few years older than me; but I didn&apos;t want to do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the very morning of the wedding.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It missed him, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Friday. Was it to be in church?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour&apos;s, near</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">King&apos;s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since then to throw any light upon what became of him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gives a meaning to it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happened.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you have no notion as to what it could have been?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One more question. How did your mother take the matter?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;And your father? Did you tell him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">half-mad to think of it, and I can&apos;t sleep a wink at night.&quot; She</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heavily into it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall glance into the case for you,&quot; said Holmes, rising, &quot;and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then you don&apos;t think I&apos;ll see him again?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I fear not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then what has happened to him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spare.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I advertised for him in last Saturday&apos;s Chronicle,&quot; said she.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. And your address?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mr. Angel&apos;s address you never had, I understand. Where is your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">father&apos;s place of business?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He travels for Westhouse &amp; Marbank, the great claret importers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Fenchurch Street.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to affect your life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she might be summoned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">infinite languor in his face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite an interesting study, that maiden,&quot; he observed. &quot;I found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">consult my index, in Andover in &apos;77, and there was something of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there were one or two details which were new to me. But the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">maiden herself was most instructive.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">invisible to me,&quot; I remarked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now, what did you gather from that woman&apos;s appearance? Describe</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn&apos;t</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">easy-going way.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">first glance is always at a woman&apos;s sleeve. In a man it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">useful material for showing traces. The double line a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to surprise her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It surprised me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And what else?&quot; I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my friend&apos;s incisive reasoning.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I held the little printed slip to the light.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Missing,&quot; it said, &quot;on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That will do,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;As to the letters,&quot; he continued,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glancing over them, &quot;they are very commonplace. Absolutely no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They are typewritten,&quot; I remarked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">neat little &apos;Hosmer Angel&apos; at the bottom. There is a date, you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fact, we may call it conclusive.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Of what?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bears upon the case?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instituted.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other is to the young lady&apos;s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him whether he could meet us here at six o&apos;clock tomorrow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the shelf for the interim.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend&apos;s subtle powers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">indeed which he could not unravel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sutherland.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">o&apos;clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chemical work which was so dear to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, have you solved it?&quot; I asked as I entered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no, the mystery!&quot; I cried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sutherland?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passage and a tap at the door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This is the girl&apos;s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes. &quot;He has written to me to say that he would be here at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">six. Come in!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I think that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appointment with me for six o&apos;clock?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On the contrary,&quot; said Holmes quietly; &quot;I have every reason to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. &quot;I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delighted to hear it,&quot; he said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is a curious thing,&quot; remarked Holmes, &quot;that a typewriter has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really quite as much individuality as a man&apos;s handwriting. Unless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in every case there is some little slurring over of the &apos;e,&apos; and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a slight defect in the tail of the &apos;r.&apos; There are fourteen other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">characteristics, but those are the more obvious.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and no doubt it is a little worn,&quot; our visitor answered, glancing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Windibank,&quot; Holmes continued. &quot;I think of writing another</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only are the &apos;e&apos;s&apos; slurred and the &apos;r&apos;s&apos; tailless, but you will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. &quot;I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he said. &quot;If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when you have done it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the door. &quot;I let you know, then, that I have caught him!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What! where?&quot; shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, it won&apos;t do--really it won&apos;t,&quot; said Holmes suavely. &quot;There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">right! Sit down and let us talk it over.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glitter of moisture on his brow. &quot;It--it&apos;s not actionable,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stammered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than to us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The man married a woman very much older than himself for her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money,&quot; said he, &quot;and he enjoyed the use of the money of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">girl&apos;s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other lovers by making love himself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was only a joke at first,&quot; groaned our visitor. &quot;We never</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought that she would have been so carried away.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gentleman&apos;s attentions, and the effect was increased by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">girl&apos;s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady&apos;s mind and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">events, Mr. Windibank!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sneer upon his pale face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he, &quot;but if you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">constraint.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The law cannot, as you say, touch you,&quot; said Holmes, unlocking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and throwing open the door, &quot;yet there never was a man who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the man&apos;s face, &quot;it is not part of my duties to my client, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here&apos;s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">myself to--&quot; He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There&apos;s a cold-blooded scoundrel!&quot; said Holmes, laughing, as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">threw himself down into his chair once more. &quot;That fellow will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entirely devoid of interest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,&quot; I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">direction.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And how did you verify them?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whether it answered to the description of any of their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Westhouse &amp; Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">description tallied in every respect with that of their employé,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">James Windibank. Voilà tout!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And Miss Sutherland?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Persian saying, &apos;There is danger for him who taketh the tiger</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in this way:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Leave Paddington by the 11:15.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What do you say, dear?&quot; said my wife, looking across at me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Will you go?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I really don&apos;t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">present.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes&apos; cases.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through one of them,&quot; I answered. &quot;But if I am to go, I must pack</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at once, for I have only half an hour.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is really very good of you to come, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">get the tickets.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have you heard anything of the case?&quot; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">simple cases which are so extremely difficult.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That sounds a little paradoxical.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have established a very serious case against the son of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">murdered man.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is a murder, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been able to understand it, in a very few words.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">families. Now for the facts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back alive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrested, and a verdict of &apos;wilful murder&apos; having been returned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before the coroner and the police-court.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I could hardly imagine a more damning case,&quot; I remarked. &quot;If</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,&quot; answered Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thoughtfully. &quot;It may seem to point very straight to one thing,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">digesting their breakfasts at home.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am afraid,&quot; said I, &quot;that the facts are so obvious that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will find little credit to be gained out of this case.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">answered, laughing. &quot;Besides, we may chance to hit upon some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even so self-evident a thing as that.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How on earth--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inference. Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the inquest, and which are worth considering.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What are they?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coroner&apos;s jury.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was a confession,&quot; I ejaculated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">least a most suspicious remark.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On the contrary,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;it is the brightest rift which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">guilty one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I shook my head. &quot;Many men have been hanged on far slighter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">evidence,&quot; I remarked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What is the young man&apos;s own account of the matter?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and gave evidence as follows: &apos;I had been away from home for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the pool I heard a cry of &quot;Cooee!&quot; which was a usual signal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner&apos;s lodge-keeper,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he died?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">allusion to a rat.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: What did you understand by that?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delirious.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had this final quarrel?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness: I should prefer not to answer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">followed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness: I must still refuse.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: I understand that the cry of &apos;Cooee&apos; was a common</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">signal between you and your father?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness: It was.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fatally injured?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Witness: Nothing definite.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Coroner: What do you mean?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, it was gone.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You cannot say what it was?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, I had a feeling something was there.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;How far from the body?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;A dozen yards or so.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And how far from the edge of the wood?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;About the same.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yards of it?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, but with my back towards it.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This concluded the examination of the witness.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see,&quot; said I as I glanced down the column, &quot;that the coroner</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his singular account of his father&apos;s dying words. They are all,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as he remarks, very much against the son.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the cushioned seat. &quot;Both you and the coroner have been at some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pains,&quot; said he, &quot;to single out the very strongest points in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">young man&apos;s favour. Don&apos;t you see that you alternately give him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there in twenty minutes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>It was nearly four o&apos;clock when we at last, after passing through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room had already been engaged for us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have ordered a carriage,&quot; said Lestrade as we sat over a cup</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of tea. &quot;I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was very nice and complimentary of you,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is entirely a question of barometric pressure.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade looked startled. &quot;I do not quite follow,&quot; he said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shall use the carriage to-night.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade laughed indulgently. &quot;You have, no doubt, already formed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your conclusions from the newspapers,&quot; he said. &quot;The case is as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it becomes. Still, of course, one can&apos;t refuse a lady, and such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">soul! here is her carriage at the door.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overpowering excitement and concern.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!&quot; she cried, glancing from one to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other of us, and finally, with a woman&apos;s quick intuition,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fastening upon my companion, &quot;I am so glad that you have come. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn&apos;t do it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You may rely upon my doing all that I can.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think that he is innocent?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that it is very probable.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;There, now!&quot; she cried, throwing back her head and looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">defiantly at Lestrade. &quot;You hear! He gives me hopes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I am afraid that my colleague</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,&quot; he said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I was concerned in it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In what way?&quot; asked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And your father?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;Was he in favour of such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">union?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">favour of it.&quot; A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you for this information,&quot; said he. &quot;May I see your father</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if I call to-morrow?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am afraid the doctor won&apos;t allow it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The doctor?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha! In Victoria! That is important.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, at the mines.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">made his money.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, certainly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tell him that I know him to be innocent.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will, Miss Turner.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.&quot; She</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am ashamed of you, Holmes,&quot; said Lestrade with dignity after a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">few minutes&apos; silence. &quot;Why should you raise up hopes which you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call it cruel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes. &quot;Have you an order to see him in prison?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, but only for you and me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ample.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">day. Supposing that this unhappy young man&apos;s story were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes&apos; attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">did not wonder at Lestrade&apos;s opinion, and yet I had so much faith</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in Sherlock Holmes&apos; insight that I could not lose hope as long</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">McCarthy&apos;s innocence.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The glass still keeps very high,&quot; he remarked as he sat down.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">McCarthy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And what did you learn from him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Could he throw no light?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sound at heart.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot admire his taste,&quot; I remarked, &quot;if it is indeed a fact</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this Miss Turner.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he has suffered.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But if he is innocent, who has done it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Cooee!&apos; before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">minor matters until to-morrow.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bright and cloudless. At nine o&apos;clock Lestrade called for us with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Pool.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is serious news this morning,&quot; Lestrade observed. &quot;It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">despaired of.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;An elderly man, I presume?&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of McCarthy&apos;s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed! That is interesting,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about here speaks of his kindness to him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">marrying his son to Turner&apos;s daughter, who is, presumably,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deduce something from that?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We have got to the deductions and the inferences,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade, winking at me. &quot;I find it hard enough to tackle facts,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are right,&quot; said Holmes demurely; &quot;you do find it very hard</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to tackle the facts.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">difficult to get hold of,&quot; replied Lestrade with some warmth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And that is--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,&quot; said Holmes,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laughing. &quot;But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Farm upon the left.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, that is it.&quot; It was a widespread, comfortable-looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when the maid, at Holmes&apos; request, showed us the boots which her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">son&apos;s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">definite end.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">landowner&apos;s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What did you go into the pool for?&quot; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or other trace. But how on earth--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the same feet.&quot; He drew out a lens and lay down upon his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself than to us. &quot;These are young McCarthy&apos;s feet. Twice he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the father&apos;s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?&quot; He ran up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">highroad, where all traces were lost.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It has been a case of considerable interest,&quot; he remarked,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">returning to his natural manner. &quot;I fancy that this grey house on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I shall be with you presently.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had picked up in the wood.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This may interest you, Lestrade,&quot; he remarked, holding it out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The murder was done with it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see no marks.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There are none.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How do you know, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weapon.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And the murderer?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enough to aid us in our search.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade laughed. &quot;I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said. &quot;Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hard-headed British jury.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nous verrons,&quot; answered Holmes calmly. &quot;You work your own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and shall probably return to London by the evening train.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And leave your case unfinished?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, finished.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But the mystery?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is solved.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Who was the criminal, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The gentleman I describe.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But who is he?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">populous neighbourhood.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I am a practical man,&quot; he said,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;All right,&quot; said Holmes quietly. &quot;I have given you the chance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I leave.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself in a perplexing position.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Look here, Watson,&quot; he said when the cloth was cleared &quot;just sit</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don&apos;t</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cigar and let me expound.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T1">&quot;Pray do so.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">young McCarthy&apos;s narrative which struck us both instantly,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was the fact that his father should, according to his account,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cry &apos;Cooee!&apos; before seeing him. The other was his singular dying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that was all that caught the son&apos;s ear. Now from this double</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">point our research must commence, and we will begin it by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;What of this &apos;Cooee!&apos; then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he was within earshot. The &apos;Cooee!&apos; was meant to attract the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Cooee&apos; is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">someone who had been in Australia.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What of the rat, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it out on the table. &quot;This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he said. &quot;I wired to Bristol for it last night.&quot; He put his hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over part of the map. &quot;What do you read?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;ARAT,&quot; I read.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And now?&quot; He raised his hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;BALLARAT.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is wonderful!&quot; I exclaimed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which, granting the son&apos;s statement to be correct, was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hardly wander.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But how did you gain them?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trifles.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, they were peculiar boots.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But his lameness?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was lame.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But his left-handedness.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which are rolled in Rotterdam.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And the cigar-holder?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Holmes,&quot; I said, &quot;you have drawn a net round this man from which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">direction in which all this points. The culprit is--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mr. John Turner,&quot; cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray sit down on the sofa,&quot; said Holmes gently. &quot;You had my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">note?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see me here to avoid scandal.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And why did you wish to see me?&quot; He looked across at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was already answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. &quot;It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>is so. I know all about McCarthy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The old man sank his face in his hands. &quot;God help me!&quot; he cried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Assizes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am glad to hear you say so,&quot; said Holmes gravely.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I am arrested.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It may not come to that,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Young McCarthy must be got off, however.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am a dying man,&quot; said old Turner. &quot;I have had diabetes for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a bundle of paper before him. &quot;Just tell us the truth,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said. &quot;I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not use it unless it is absolutely needed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s as well,&quot; said the old man; &quot;it&apos;s a question whether I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will not take me long to tell.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You didn&apos;t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and he has blasted my life. I&apos;ll tell you first how I came to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in his power.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was in the early &apos;60&apos;s at the diggings. I was a young chap</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foot.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Here we are, Jack,&apos; says he, touching me on the arm; &apos;we&apos;ll be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as good as a family to you. There&apos;s two of us, me and my son, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you can have the keeping of us. If you don&apos;t--it&apos;s a fine,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">law-abiding country is England, and there&apos;s always a policeman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">within hail.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I could not give. He asked for Alice.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to talk it over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occurred.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, it is not for me to judge you,&quot; said Holmes as the old man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">signed the statement which had been drawn out. &quot;I pray that we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may never be exposed to such a temptation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dead, shall be safe with us.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Farewell, then,&quot; said the old man solemnly. &quot;Your own deathbeds,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which you have given to mine.&quot; Tottering and shaking in all his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;God help us!&quot; said Holmes after a long silence. &quot;Why does fate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a case as this that I do not think of Baxter&apos;s words, and say,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">past.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cases between the years &apos;82 and &apos;90, I am faced by so many which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">present strange and interesting features that it is no easy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">points in connection with it which never have been, and probably</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never will be, entirely cleared up.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>The year &apos;87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">British barque &quot;Sophy Anderson&quot;, of the singular adventures of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man&apos;s watch, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them present such singular features as the strange train of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other was deep in one of Clark Russell&apos;s fine sea-stories until</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother&apos;s, and for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why,&quot; said I, glancing up at my companion, &quot;that was surely the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Except yourself I have none,&quot; he answered. &quot;I do not encourage</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">visitors.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A client, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">likely to be some crony of the landlady&apos;s.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Come in!&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weighed down with some great anxiety.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I owe you an apology,&quot; he said, raising his golden pince-nez to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his eyes. &quot;I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chamber.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Give me your coat and umbrella,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;They may rest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the south-west, I see.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, from Horsham.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quite distinctive.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have come for advice.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is easily got.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And help.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is not always so easy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He said that you could solve anything.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He said too much.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That you are never beaten.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woman.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But what is that compared with the number of your successes?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is true that I have been generally successful.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then you may be so with me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with some details as to your case.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is no ordinary one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appeal.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">events than those which have happened in my own family.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You fill me with interest,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Pray give us the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">question you as to those details which seem to me to be most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">important.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">towards the blaze.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My name,&quot; said he, &quot;is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">affair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon a handsome competence.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson&apos;s army,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">three fields round his house, and there he would take his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">friends, not even his own brother.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He didn&apos;t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">make me his representative both with the servants and with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anyone else to enter. With a boy&apos;s curiosity I have peeped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>lay upon the table in front of the colonel&apos;s plate. It was not a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. &apos;From</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">India!&apos; said he as he took it up, &apos;Pondicherry postmark! What can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this be?&apos; Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">still held in his trembling hand, &apos;K. K. K.!&apos; he shrieked, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then, &apos;My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What is it, uncle?&apos; I cried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Death,&apos; said he, and rising from the table he retired to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;They may do what they like, but I&apos;ll checkmate them still,&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he with an oath. &apos;Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">envelope.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I wish you, John,&apos; said my uncle, &apos;to witness my will. I leave</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can&apos;t</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where Mr. Fordham shows you.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were new raised from a basin.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we went to search for him, face downward in a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought in a verdict of &apos;suicide.&apos; But I, who knew how he winced</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One moment,&quot; Holmes interposed, &quot;your statement is, I foresee,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the date of his supposed suicide.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">later, upon the night of May 2nd.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. Pray proceed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register&apos; written beneath.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle&apos;s life in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">politicians who had been sent down from the North.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, it was the beginning of &apos;84 when my father came to live at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">January of &apos;85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Why, what on earth does this mean, John?&apos; he stammered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My heart had turned to lead. &apos;It is K. K. K.,&apos; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He looked inside the envelope. &apos;So it is,&apos; he cried. &apos;Here are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the very letters. But what is this written above them?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Put the papers on the sundial,&apos; I read, peeping over his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shoulder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What papers? What sundial?&apos; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The sundial in the garden. There is no other,&apos; said I; &apos;but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">papers must be those that are destroyed.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Pooh!&apos; said he, gripping hard at his courage. &apos;We are in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">civilised land here, and we can&apos;t have tomfoolery of this kind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Where does the thing come from?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;From Dundee,&apos; I answered, glancing at the postmark.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Some preposterous practical joke,&apos; said he. &apos;What have I to do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nonsense.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I should certainly speak to the police,&apos; I said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Then let me do so?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, I forbid you. I won&apos;t have a fuss made about such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nonsense.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forebodings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bringing in a verdict of &apos;death from accidental causes.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woven round him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">incident in my uncle&apos;s life, and that the danger would be as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pressing in one house as in another.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was in January, &apos;85, that my poor father met his end, and two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which it had come upon my father.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">orange pips.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This is the envelope,&quot; he continued. &quot;The postmark is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon my father&apos;s last message: &apos;K. K. K.&apos;; and then &apos;Put the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">papers on the sundial.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What have you done?&quot; asked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nothing?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To tell the truth&quot;--he sank his face into his thin, white</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hands--&quot;I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and no precautions can guard against.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Tut! tut!&quot; cried Sherlock Holmes. &quot;You must act, man, or you are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">despair.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have seen the police.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the warnings.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. &quot;Incredible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">imbecility!&quot; he cried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the house with me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Has he come with you to-night?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No. His orders were to stay in the house.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>Again Holmes raved in the air.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why did you come to me,&quot; he cried, &quot;and, above all, why did you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not come at once?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might help us?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is one thing,&quot; said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paper, he laid it out upon the table. &quot;I have some remembrance,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he, &quot;that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">undoubtedly my uncle&apos;s.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a book. It was headed, &quot;March, 1869,&quot; and beneath were the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">following enigmatical notices:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="6"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">John Swain, of St. Augustine.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;9th. McCauley cleared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;10th. John Swain cleared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;12th. Visited Paramore. All well.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you!&quot; said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to our visitor. &quot;And now you must on no account lose another</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me. You must get home instantly and act.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What shall I do?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you understand?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Entirely.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">guilty parties.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I thank you,&quot; said the young man, rising and pulling on his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overcoat. &quot;You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainly do as you advise.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go back?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;By train from Waterloo.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">closely.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am armed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall see you at Horsham, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">particular.&quot; He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once more.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think, Watson,&quot; he remarked at last, &quot;that of all our cases we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have had none more fantastic than this.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sholtos.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But have you,&quot; I asked, &quot;formed any definite conception as to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what these perils are?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;There can be no question as to their nature,&quot; he answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this unhappy family?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. &quot;The ideal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reasoner,&quot; he remarked, &quot;would, when he had once been shown a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in a very precise fashion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered, laughing. &quot;It was a singular document.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">main points of my analysis.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes grinned at the last item. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I say now, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;American Encyclopaedia&apos; which stands upon the shelf beside you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">considering the formidable letters which were received by himself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">letters?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">third from London.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;From East London. What do you deduce from that?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Does that suggest anything?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A greater distance to travel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But the letter had also a greater distance to come.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I do not see the point.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their singular warning or token before them when starting upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">writer.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is possible.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good God!&quot; I cried. &quot;What can it mean, this relentless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">persecution?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as to deceive a coroner&apos;s jury. There must have been several in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">individual and becomes the badge of a society.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But of what society?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have you never--&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sinking his voice--&quot;have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I never have.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. &quot;Here it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is,&quot; said he presently:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the efforts of the United States government and of the better</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will observe,&quot; said Holmes, laying down the volume, &quot;that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">You can understand that this register and diary may implicate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then the page we have seen--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, &apos;sent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the pips to A, B, and C&apos;--that is, sent the society&apos;s warning to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ways of our fellow-men.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will excuse me for not waiting for you,&quot; said he; &quot;I have, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">young Openshaw&apos;s.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What steps will you take?&quot; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will not go there first?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">maid will bring up your coffee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chill to my heart.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Holmes,&quot; I cried, &quot;you are too late.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah!&quot; said he, laying down his cup, &quot;I feared as much. How was it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">done?&quot; He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading &apos;Tragedy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Near Waterloo Bridge.&apos; Here is the account:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which should have the effect of calling the attention of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shaken than I had ever seen him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That hurts my pride, Watson,&quot; he said at last. &quot;It is a petty</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I should send him away to his death--!&quot; He sprang from his chair</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unclasping of his long thin hands.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They must be cunning devils,&quot; he exclaimed at last. &quot;How could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To the police?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">take the flies, but not before.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o&apos;clock before he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">washing it down with a long draught of water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are hungry,&quot; I remarked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breakfast.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nothing?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And how have you succeeded?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have a clue?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;S. H. for J. O.&quot; Then he sealed it and addressed it to &quot;Captain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">James Calhoun, Barque &apos;Lone Star,&apos; Savannah, Georgia.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That will await him when he enters port,&quot; said he, chuckling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And who is this Captain Calhoun?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How did you trace it, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dates and names.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have spent the whole day,&quot; said he, &quot;over Lloyd&apos;s registers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and files of the old papers, following the future career of every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reported there during those months. Of these, one, the &apos;Lone Star,&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one of the states of the Union.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Texas, I think.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have an American origin.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Lone Star&apos; was there in January, &apos;85, my suspicion became a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the port of London.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The &apos;Lone Star&apos; had arrived here last week. I went down to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What will you do, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">news of the &quot;Lone Star&quot; of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of a wave, with the letters &quot;L. S.&quot; carved upon it, and that is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all which we shall ever know of the fate of the &quot;Lone Star.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the Theological College of St. George&apos;s, was much addicted to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Quincey&apos;s description of his dreams and sensations, he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">One night--it was in June, &apos;89--there came a ring to my bell,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A patient!&quot; said she. &quot;You&apos;ll have to go out.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will excuse my calling so late,&quot; she began, and then,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about my wife&apos;s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. &quot;Oh, I&apos;m in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">such trouble!&quot; she cried; &quot;I do so want a little help.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why,&quot; said my wife, pulling up her veil, &quot;it is Kate Whitney.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you came in.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I didn&apos;t know what to do, so I came straight to you.&quot; That was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to a light-house.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should you rather that I sent James off to bed?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, no, no! I want the doctor&apos;s advice and help, too. It&apos;s about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">husband&apos;s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible that we could bring him back to her?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney&apos;s medical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forecastle of an emigrant ship.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his knees, staring into the fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. I have not come to stay,&quot; said I. &quot;There is a friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unkempt, staring out at me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My God! It&apos;s Watson,&quot; said he. He was in a pitiable state of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. &quot;I say, Watson, what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">o&apos;clock is it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nearly eleven.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Of what day?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Of Friday, June 19th.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">d&apos;you want to frighten a chap for?&quot; He sank his face onto his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arms and began to sob in a high treble key.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So I am. But you&apos;ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I&apos;ll</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go home with you. I wouldn&apos;t frighten Kate--poor little Kate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Give me your hand! Have you a cab?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, I have one waiting.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">skirt, and a low voice whispered, &quot;Walk past me, and then look</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back at me.&quot; The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Holmes!&quot; I whispered, &quot;what on earth are you doing in this den?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;As low as you can,&quot; he answered; &quot;I have excellent ears. If you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have a cab outside.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes&apos; requests, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was once confined in the cab my mission was practically</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney&apos;s bill, led him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">burst into a hearty fit of laughter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I suppose, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;that you imagine that I have added</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">views.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was certainly surprised to find you there.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But not more so than I to find you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I came to find a friend.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And I to find an enemy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;An enemy?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hour&apos;s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">building, near the corner of Paul&apos;s Wharf, which could tell some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nights.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What! You do not mean bodies?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trap should be here.&quot; He put his two forefingers between his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of wheels and the clink of horses&apos; hoofs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">its side lanterns. &quot;You&apos;ll come with me, won&apos;t you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If I can be of use.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The Cedars?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair&apos;s house. I am staying there while I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>conduct the inquiry.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where is it, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But I am all in the dark.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Of course you are. You&apos;ll know all about it presently. Jump up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here&apos;s half a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">head. So long, then!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is acting for the best.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;It makes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you quite invaluable as a companion. &apos;Pon my word, it is a great</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You forget that I know nothing about it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">get nothing to go upon. There&apos;s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can&apos;t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I&apos;ll state the case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spark where all is dark to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Proceed, then.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">troubles have been weighing upon his mind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in your London, you will know that the office of the company is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company&apos;s office,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so far?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is very clear.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you found me to-night--and running through the front room she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">swore that no one else had been in the front room during the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a cascade of children&apos;s bricks. It was the toy which he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">promised to bring home.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the tragedy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair&apos;s story, he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seconds of her husband&apos;s appearance at the window, he could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could not account in any way for the presence of the missing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gentleman&apos;s clothes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But a cripple!&quot; said I. &quot;What could he have done single-handed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">against a man in the prime of life?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strength in the others.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray continue your narrative.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">examination of the premises, but without finding anything which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">during which he might have communicated with his friend the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">searched, without anything being found which could incriminate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mrs. St. Clair&apos;s assertion that she had actually seen her husband</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair&apos;s coat, and not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what do you think they found in the pockets?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot imagine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I don&apos;t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away into the river.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pockets to make sure of the coat&apos;s sinking. He throws it out, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window when the police appeared.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It certainly sounds feasible.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been anything against him. He had for years been known as a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recall any case within my experience which looked at the first</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We are on the outskirts of Lee,&quot; said my companion. &quot;We have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little doubt, caught the clink of our horse&apos;s feet.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?&quot; I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse&apos;s head, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">question.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well?&quot; she cried, &quot;well?&quot; And then, seeing that there were two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No good news?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No bad?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had a long day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">investigation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am delighted to see you,&quot; said she, pressing my hand warmly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suddenly upon us.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear madam,&quot; said I, &quot;I am an old campaigner, and if I were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">indeed happy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&quot; said the lady as we entered a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been laid out, &quot;I should very much like to ask you one or two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">answer.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly, madam.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Upon what point?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Frankly, now!&quot; she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Frankly, then, madam, I do not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You think that he is dead?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I do.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Murdered?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I don&apos;t say that. Perhaps.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And on what day did he meet his death?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On Monday.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">galvanised.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What!&quot; he roared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, to-day.&quot; She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paper in the air.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;May I see it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before, for it was considerably after midnight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Coarse writing,&quot; murmured Holmes. &quot;Surely this is not your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">husband&apos;s writing, madam.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, but the enclosure is.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and inquire as to the address.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How can you tell that?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there has been an enclosure here!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you are sure that this is your husband&apos;s hand?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One of his hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">writing, and yet I know it well.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.&apos; Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand, madam?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None. Neville wrote those words.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">danger is over.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">posted to-day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is possible.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If so, much may have happened between.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very much so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Was the window open?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then he might have called to you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He might.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A call for help, you thought?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. He waved his hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is possible.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you thought he was pulled back?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He disappeared so suddenly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ordinary clothes on?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">throat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Never.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Never.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-morrow.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shag which I had seen upon the previous night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Awake, Watson?&quot; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Game for a morning drive?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.&quot; He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">putting in the horse.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I want to test a little theory of mine,&quot; said he, pulling on his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">boots. &quot;I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">key of the affair now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And where is it?&quot; I asked, smiling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In the bathroom,&quot; he answered. &quot;Oh, yes, I am not joking,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">continued, seeing my look of incredulity. &quot;I have just been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not fit the lock.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some city in a dream.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It has been in some points a singular case,&quot; said Holmes,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flicking the horse on into a gallop. &quot;I confess that I have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never to learn it at all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him. One of them held the horse&apos;s head while the other led us in.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Who is on duty?&quot; asked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Inspector Bradstreet, sir.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?&quot; A tall, stout official had come</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jacket. &quot;I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.&quot; It was a small,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">desk.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Clair, of Lee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So I heard. You have him here?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In the cells.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Is he quiet?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Dirty?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face is as black as a tinker&apos;s. Well, when once his case has been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I should like to see him very much.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your bag.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I think that I&apos;ll take it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very good. Come this way, if you please.&quot; He led us down a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>side.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The third on the right is his,&quot; said the inspector. &quot;Here it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is!&quot; He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and glanced through.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He is asleep,&quot; said he. &quot;You can see him very well.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his eyes and forehead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He&apos;s a beauty, isn&apos;t he?&quot; said the inspector.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He certainly needs a wash,&quot; remarked Holmes. &quot;I had an idea that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He! he! You are a funny one,&quot; chuckled the inspector.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">figure.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know why not,&quot; said the inspector. &quot;He doesn&apos;t</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?&quot; He slipped his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prisoner&apos;s face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Let me introduce you,&quot; he shouted, &quot;to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lee, in the county of Kent.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man&apos;s face peeled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">threw himself down with his face to the pillow.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Great heavens!&quot; cried the inspector, &quot;it is, indeed, the missing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man. I know him from the photograph.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>himself to his destiny. &quot;Be it so,&quot; said he. &quot;And pray what am I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">charged with?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can&apos;t be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it,&quot; said the inspector with a grin. &quot;Well, I have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">detained.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No crime, but a very great error has been committed,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes. &quot;You would have done better to have trusted your wife.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was not the wife; it was the children,&quot; groaned the prisoner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">God! What an exposure! What can I do?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">kindly on the shoulder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he, &quot;of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">details should find their way into the papers. Inspector</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would then never go into court at all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;God bless you!&quot; cried the prisoner passionately. &quot;I would have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">less than 26s. 4d.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit&apos;s end where to get</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my secret was safe in his possession.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">country, and eventually married, without anyone having a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business in the City. She little knew what.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fear.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That note only reached her yesterday,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good God! What a week she must have spent!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The police have watched this Lascar,&quot; said Inspector Bradstreet,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That was it,&quot; said Holmes, nodding approvingly; &quot;I have no doubt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Many times; but what was a fine to me?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It must stop here, however,&quot; said Bradstreet. &quot;If the police are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">results.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I reached this one,&quot; said my friend, &quot;by sitting upon five</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purpose of examination.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are engaged,&quot; said I; &quot;perhaps I interrupt you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one&quot;--he jerked his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thumb in the direction of the old hat--&quot;but there are points in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even of instruction.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were thick with the ice crystals. &quot;I suppose,&quot; I remarked, &quot;that,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some mystery and the punishment of some crime.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no. No crime,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. &quot;Only one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">four million human beings all jostling each other within the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presented which may be striking and bizarre without being</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">criminal. We have already had experience of such.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So much so,&quot; I remarked, &quot;that of the last six cases which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">legal crime.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">You know Peterson, the commissionaire?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is to him that this trophy belongs.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is his hat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fire. The facts are these: about four o&apos;clock on Christmas</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">returning from some small jollification and was making his way</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man&apos;s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Which surely he restored to their owner?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that &apos;For</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mrs. Henry Baker&apos; was printed upon a small card which was tied to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bird&apos;s left leg, and it is also true that the initials &apos;H.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>B.&apos; are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one of them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What, then, did Peterson do?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lost his Christmas dinner.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Did he not advertise?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Only as much as we can deduce.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;From his hat?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">felt?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">article?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials &quot;H. B.&quot; were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I can see nothing,&quot; said I, handing it back to my friend.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drawing your inferences.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fashion which was characteristic of him. &quot;It is perhaps less</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suggestive than it might have been,&quot; he remarked, &quot;and yet there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his wife has ceased to love him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">continued, disregarding my remonstrance. &quot;He is a man who leads a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on in his house.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are certainly joking, Holmes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this man was intellectual?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. &quot;It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a question of cubic capacity,&quot; said he; &quot;a man with so large a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brain must have something in it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The decline of his fortunes, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foresight and the moral retrogression?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes laughed. &quot;Here is the foresight,&quot; said he putting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entirely lost his self-respect.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the best of training.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson, with a week&apos;s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">affection.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But he might be a bachelor.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wife. Remember the card upon the bird&apos;s leg.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the gas is not laid on in his house?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, it is very ingenious,&quot; said I, laughing; &quot;but since, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waste of energy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">astonishment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!&quot; he gasped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through the kitchen window?&quot; Holmes twisted himself round upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sofa to get a fairer view of the man&apos;s excited face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!&quot; He held out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">point in the dark hollow of his hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. &quot;By Jove, Peterson!&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>he, &quot;this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have got?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it were putty.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not the Countess of Morcar&apos;s blue carbuncle!&quot; I ejaculated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not within a twentieth part of the market price.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!&quot; The commissionaire</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sentimental considerations in the background which would induce</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recover the gem.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,&quot; I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter here, I believe.&quot; He rummaged amid his newspapers,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder&apos;s cry of dismay on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where she found matters as described by the last witness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carried out of court.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Hum! So much for the police-court,&quot; said Holmes thoughtfully,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tossing aside the paper. &quot;The question for us now to solve is the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What will you say?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: &apos;Found at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">221B, Baker Street.&apos; That is clear and concise.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very. But will he see it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and have this put in the evening papers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In which, sir?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James&apos;s, Evening News,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very well, sir. And this stone?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the one which your family is now devouring.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">held it against the light. &quot;It&apos;s a bonny thing,&quot; said he. &quot;Just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil&apos;s pet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gallows and the prison? I&apos;ll lock it up in my strong box now and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot tell.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anything to do with the matter?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">test if we have an answer to our advertisement.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you can do nothing until then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes&apos; room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,&quot; said he, rising from his armchair</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could so readily assume. &quot;Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes&apos; surmise as to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ill-usage at the hands of fortune.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We have retained these things for some days,&quot; said Holmes,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. &quot;Shillings have not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been so plentiful with me as they once were,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hopeless attempt at recovering them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eat it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To eat it!&quot; Our visitor half rose from his chair in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">excitement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purpose equally well?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, certainly, certainly,&quot; answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relief.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your own bird, so if you wish--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man burst into a hearty laugh. &quot;They might be useful to me as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relics of my adventure,&quot; said he, &quot;but beyond that I can hardly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the sideboard.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of his shoulders.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is your hat, then, and there your bird,&quot; said he. &quot;By the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better grown goose.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gained property under his arm. &quot;There are a few of us who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.&quot; With</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strode off upon his way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So much for Mr. Henry Baker,&quot; said Holmes when he had closed the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">door behind him. &quot;It is quite certain that he knows nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Not particularly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">up this clue while it is still hot.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;By all means.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors&apos; quarter,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My geese!&quot; The man seemed surprised.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who was a member of your goose club.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them&apos;s not our geese.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed! Whose, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Breckinridge is his name.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah! I don&apos;t know him. Well, here&apos;s your good health landlord,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and prosperity to your house. Good-night.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now for Mr. Breckinridge,&quot; he continued, buttoning up his coat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as we came out into the frosty air. &quot;Remember, Watson that though</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years&apos; penal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quick march!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">helping a boy to put up the shutters.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good-evening. It&apos;s a cold night,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Sold out of geese, I see,&quot; continued Holmes, pointing at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bare slabs of marble.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That&apos;s no good.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, but I was recommended to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Who by?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The landlord of the Alpha.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">salesman.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, then, mister,&quot; said he, with his head cocked and his arms</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">akimbo, &quot;what are you driving at? Let&apos;s have it straight, now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">geese which you supplied to the Alpha.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well then, I shan&apos;t tell you. So now!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don&apos;t know why you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be so warm over such a trifle.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Warm! You&apos;d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the business; but it&apos;s &apos;Where are the geese?&apos; and &apos;Who did you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sell the geese to?&apos; and &apos;What will you take for the geese?&apos; One</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fuss that is made over them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">making inquiries,&quot; said Holmes carelessly. &quot;If you won&apos;t tell us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bet is off, that is all. But I&apos;m always ready to back my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bird I ate is country bred.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, then, you&apos;ve lost your fiver, for it&apos;s town bred,&quot; snapped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the salesman.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s nothing of the kind.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I say it is.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I don&apos;t believe it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;D&apos;you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">went to the Alpha were town bred.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You&apos;ll never persuade me to believe that.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Will you bet, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I&apos;ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">obstinate.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The salesman chuckled grimly. &quot;Bring me the books, Bill,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lamp.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now then, Mr. Cocksure,&quot; said the salesman, &quot;I thought that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was out of geese, but before I finish you&apos;ll find that there is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">still one left in my shop. You see this little book?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That&apos;s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D&apos;you see? Well,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">read it out to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249,&quot; read Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes turned to the page indicated. &quot;Here you are, &apos;Mrs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, then, what&apos;s the last entry?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. There you are. And underneath?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What have you to say now?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fashion which was peculiar to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the &apos;Pink &apos;un&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he. &quot;I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him, that man would not have given me such complete information</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who are anxious about the matter, and I should--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I&apos;ve had enough of you and your geese,&quot; he shouted. &quot;I wish you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with your silly talk I&apos;ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Oakshott here and I&apos;ll answer her, but what have you to do with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it? Did I buy the geese off you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No; but one of them was mine all the same,&quot; whined the little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She told me to ask you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I&apos;ve had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enough of it. Get out of this!&quot; He rushed fiercely forward, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,&quot; whispered Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fellow.&quot; Striding through the scattered knots of people who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">colour had been driven from his face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Who are you, then? What do you want?&quot; he asked in a quavering</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">voice.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will excuse me,&quot; said Holmes blandly, &quot;but I could not help</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I think that I could be of assistance to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">people don&apos;t know.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you can know nothing of this?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Henry Baker is a member.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,&quot; cried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. &quot;In that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wind-swept market-place,&quot; said he. &quot;But pray tell me, before we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man hesitated for an instant. &quot;My name is John Robinson,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">answered with a sidelong glance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no; the real name,&quot; said Holmes sweetly. &quot;It is always</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">awkward doing business with an alias.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. &quot;Well then,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he, &quot;my real name is James Ryder.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">everything which you would wish to know.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tension within him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here we are!&quot; said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">You want to know what became of those geese?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tail.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ryder quivered with emotion. &quot;Oh, sir,&quot; he cried, &quot;can you tell</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me where it went to?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It came here.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don&apos;t wonder that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have it here in my museum.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The game&apos;s up, Ryder,&quot; said Holmes quietly. &quot;Hold up, man, or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you&apos;ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson. He&apos;s not got blood enough to go in for felony with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with frightened eyes at his accuser.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Countess of Morcar&apos;s?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,&quot; said he in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crackling voice.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see--her ladyship&apos;s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrested. You then--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion&apos;s knees. &quot;For God&apos;s sake, have mercy!&quot; he shrieked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I&apos;ll</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">swear it on a Bible. Oh, don&apos;t bring it into court! For Christ&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sake, don&apos;t!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Get back into your chair!&quot; said Holmes sternly. &quot;It is very well</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">charge against him will break down.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your only hope of safety.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. &quot;I will tell you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it just as it happened, sir,&quot; said he. &quot;When Horner had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be best to do.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">best detective that ever lived.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fluttered off among the others.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?&apos; says she.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well,&apos; said I, &apos;you said you&apos;d give me one for Christmas, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was feeling which was the fattest.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh,&apos; says she, &apos;we&apos;ve set yours aside for you--Jem&apos;s bird, we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call it. It&apos;s the big white one over yonder. There&apos;s twenty-six</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the market.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Thank you, Maggie,&apos; says I; &apos;but if it is all the same to you,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I&apos;d rather have that one I was handling just now.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The other is a good three pound heavier,&apos; said she, &apos;and we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fattened it expressly for you.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Never mind. I&apos;ll have the other, and I&apos;ll take it now,&apos; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, just as you like,&apos; said she, a little huffed. &apos;Which is it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you want, then?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flock.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rushed back to my sister&apos;s, and hurried into the back yard. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was not a bird to be seen there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Where are they all, Maggie?&apos; I cried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Gone to the dealer&apos;s, Jem.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Which dealer&apos;s?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;But was there another with a barred tail?&apos; I asked, &apos;the same</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as the one I chose?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tell them apart.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I sold my character. God help me! God help me!&quot; He burst into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes&apos; finger-tips upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Get out!&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No more words. Get out!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">footfalls from the street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;After all, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clay pipe, &quot;I am not retained by the police to supply their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feature.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presented more singular features than that which was associated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The events in question occurred in the early days of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more terrible than the truth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was early in April in the year &apos;83 that I woke one morning to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;but it&apos;s the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">retorted upon me, and I on you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What is it, then--a fire?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call you and give you the chance.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the window, rose as we entered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good-morning, madam,&quot; said Holmes cheerily. &quot;My name is Sherlock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is not cold which makes me shiver,&quot; said the woman in a low</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">voice, changing her seat as requested.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.&quot; She raised her veil as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all-comprehensive glances.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You must not fear,&quot; said he soothingly, bending forward and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">patting her forearm. &quot;We shall soon set matters right, I have no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You know me, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the station.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is no mystery, my dear madam,&quot; said he, smiling. &quot;The left</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sit on the left-hand side of the driver.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she. &quot;I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shall not find me ungrateful.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case-book, which he consulted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Farintosh,&quot; said he. &quot;Ah yes, I recall the case; it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Alas!&quot; replied our visitor, &quot;the very horror of my situation</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the dangers which encompass me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am all attention, madam.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Surrey.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes nodded his head. &quot;The name is familiar to me,&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the time of my mother&apos;s re-marriage. She had a considerable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">family, and in my stepfather&apos;s case it had, I believe, been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could gather together that I was able to avert another public</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">villagers almost as much as their master.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">begun to whiten, even as mine has.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your sister is dead, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother&apos;s maiden</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lids now and glanced across at his visitor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray be precise as to details,&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the first is Dr. Roylott&apos;s, the second my sister&apos;s, and the third</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Perfectly so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eleven o&apos;clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and looked back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Tell me, Helen,&apos; said she, &apos;have you ever heard anyone whistle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the dead of the night?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Never,&apos; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your sleep?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Certainly not. But why?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Because during the last few nights I have always, about three</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">just ask you whether you had heard it.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">plantation.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">did not hear it also.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.&apos; She smiled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">key turn in the lock.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Was it your custom always to lock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yourselves in at night?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Always.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And why?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">locked.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that it was my sister&apos;s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister&apos;s door was unlocked,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in a voice which I shall never forget, &apos;Oh, my God! Helen! It was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the band! The speckled band!&apos; There was something else which she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">air in the direction of the doctor&apos;s room, but a fresh convulsion</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressing-gown. When he reached my sister&apos;s side she was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she slowly sank and died without having recovered her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One moment,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;are you sure about this whistle and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">metallic sound? Could you swear to it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been deceived.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Was your sister dressed?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the coroner come to?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How about poison?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The doctors examined her for it, but without success.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, there are nearly always some there.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">speckled band?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she used.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;These are very deep waters,&quot; said he; &quot;pray go on with your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">narrative.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">advice.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have done wisely,&quot; said my friend. &quot;But have you told me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why, what do you mean?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor&apos;s knee. Five little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the white wrist.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have been cruelly used,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. &quot;He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is a hard man,&quot; she said, &quot;and perhaps he hardly knows his own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strength.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This is a very deep business,&quot; he said at last. &quot;There are a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stepfather?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">most important business. It is probable that he will be away all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">get her out of the way.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;By no means.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in town. But I shall return by the twelve o&apos;clock train, so as to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be there in time for your coming.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breakfast?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again this afternoon.&quot; She dropped her thick black veil over her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face and glided from the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;And what do you think of it all, Watson?&quot; asked Sherlock Holmes,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leaning back in his chair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Dark enough and sinister enough.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mysterious end.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very peculiar words of the dying woman?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot think.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an interest in preventing his stepdaughter&apos;s marriage, the dying</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">place, I think that there is good ground to think that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mystery may be cleared along those lines.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But what, then, did the gipsies do?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot imagine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see many objections to any such theory.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the devil!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bird of prey.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Which of you is Holmes?&quot; asked this apparition.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,&quot; said my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion quietly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Indeed, Doctor,&quot; said Holmes blandly. &quot;Pray take a seat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have traced her. What has she been saying to you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is a little cold for the time of the year,&quot; said Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What has she been saying to you?&quot; screamed the old man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">furiously.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,&quot; continued my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion imperturbably.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha! You put me off, do you?&quot; said our new visitor, taking a step</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forward and shaking his hunting-crop. &quot;I know you, you scoundrel!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">My friend smiled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Holmes, the busybody!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His smile broadened.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes chuckled heartily. &quot;Your conversation is most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entertaining,&quot; said he. &quot;When you go out close the door, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there is a decided draught.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will go when I have said my say. Don&apos;t you dare to meddle with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.&quot; He stepped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his huge brown hands.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;See that you keep yourself out of my grip,&quot; he snarled, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He seems a very amiable person,&quot; said Holmes, laughing. &quot;I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.&quot; As he spoke</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">straightened it out again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down to Doctors&apos; Commons, where I hope to get some data which may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">help us in this matter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was nearly one o&apos;clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over with notes and figures.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have seen the will of the deceased wife,&quot; said he. &quot;To</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">total income, which at the time of the wife&apos;s death was little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a very serious extent. My morning&apos;s work has not been wasted,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pocket. An Eley&apos;s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are, I think, all that we need.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Look there!&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very old mansion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Stoke Moran?&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,&quot; remarked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the driver.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is some building going on there,&quot; said Holmes; &quot;that is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where we are going.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There&apos;s the village,&quot; said the driver, pointing to a cluster of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">roofs some distance to the left; &quot;but if you want to get to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house, you&apos;ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">walking.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,&quot; observed Holmes, shading</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his eyes. &quot;Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to Leatherhead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I thought it as well,&quot; said Holmes as we climbed the stile,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our word.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face which spoke her joy. &quot;I have been waiting so eagerly for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you,&quot; she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. &quot;All has turned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he will be back before evening.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We have had the pleasure of making the doctor&apos;s acquaintance,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; she cried, &quot;he has followed me, then.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So it appears.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will he say when he returns?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your aunt&apos;s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">examine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outsides of the windows.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the centre one to your sister&apos;s, and the one next to the main</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">building to Dr. Roylott&apos;s chamber?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wall.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are windows in it, of course?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to go into your room and bar your shutters?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">firmly into the massive masonry. &quot;Hum!&quot; said he, scratching his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chin in some perplexity, &quot;my theory certainly presents some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the matter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">taking in every detail of the apartment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where does that bell communicate with?&quot; he asked at last</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tassel actually lying upon the pillow.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It goes to the housekeeper&apos;s room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It looks newer than the other things?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your sister asked for it, I suppose?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wanted for ourselves.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this floor.&quot; He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why, it&apos;s a dummy,&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Won&apos;t it ring?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the little opening for the ventilator is.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How very absurd! I never noticed that before.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very strange!&quot; muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. &quot;There are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one or two very singular points about this room. For example,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with the outside air!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is also quite modern,&quot; said the lady.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Done about the same time as the bell-rope?&quot; remarked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the inner apartment.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Dr. Grimesby Roylott&apos;s chamber was larger than that of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and all of them with the keenest interest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What&apos;s in here?&quot; he asked, tapping the safe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My stepfather&apos;s business papers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh! you have seen inside, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">papers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There isn&apos;t a cat in it, for example?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No. What a strange idea!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, look at this!&quot; He took up a small saucer of milk which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stood on the top of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No; we don&apos;t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.&quot; He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of it with the greatest attention.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. That is quite settled,&quot; said he, rising and putting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his lens in his pocket. &quot;Hullo! Here is something interesting!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What do you make of that, Watson?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s a common enough lash. But I don&apos;t know why it should be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tied.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it&apos;s a wicked world,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had never seen my friend&apos;s face so grim or his brow so dark as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">roused himself from his reverie.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is very essential, Miss Stoner,&quot; said he, &quot;that you should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absolutely follow my advice in every respect.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall most certainly do so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">depend upon your compliance.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I assure you that I am in your hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">village inn over there?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, that is the Crown.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, easily.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The rest you will leave in our hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But what will you do?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion&apos;s sleeve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Perhaps I have.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, for pity&apos;s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">death.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if she died from some sudden fright.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that threaten you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the hoarse roar of the doctor&apos;s voice and saw the fury with which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you know, Watson,&quot; said Holmes as we sat together in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gathering darkness, &quot;I have really some scruples as to taking you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Can I be of assistance?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your presence might be invaluable.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I shall certainly come.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is very kind of you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than was visible to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that you saw all that I did.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You saw the ventilator, too?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rat could hardly pass through.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Stoke Moran.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sister could smell Dr. Roylott&apos;s cigar. Now, of course that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suggested at once that there must be a communication between the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked upon at the coroner&apos;s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But what harm can there be in that?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bed dies. Does not that strike you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot as yet see any connection.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like that before?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot say that I have.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Holmes,&quot; I cried, &quot;I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crime.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before the night is over; for goodness&apos; sake let us have a quiet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cheerful.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">About nine o&apos;clock the light among the trees was extinguished,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is our signal,&quot; said Holmes, springing to his feet; &quot;it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comes from the middle window.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My God!&quot; I whispered; &quot;did you see it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laugh and put his lips to my ear.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is a nice household,&quot; he murmured. &quot;That is the baboon.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after following Holmes&apos; example and slipping off my shoes, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">distinguish the words:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The least sound would be fatal to our plans.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I nodded to show that I had heard.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We must sit without light. He would see it through the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ventilator.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I nodded again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bed, and you in that chair.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whatever might befall.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his cane at the bell-pull.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You see it, Watson?&quot; he yelled. &quot;You see it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had died away into the silence from which it rose.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What can it mean?&quot; I gasped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It means that it is all over,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;And perhaps,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enter Dr. Roylott&apos;s room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The band! the speckled band!&quot; whispered Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is a swamp adder!&quot; cried Holmes; &quot;the deadliest snake in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some place of shelter and let the county police know what has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happened.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man&apos;s lap,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and throwing the noose round the reptile&apos;s neck he drew it from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm&apos;s length, threw it into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the iron safe, which he closed upon it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">next day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I had,&quot; said he, &quot;come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the word &apos;band,&apos; which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">come either from the window or the door. My attention was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sooner or later she must fall a victim.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">light and attacked it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;With the result of driving it through the ventilator.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Grimesby Roylott&apos;s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weigh very heavily upon my conscience.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER&apos;S THUMB</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">notice--that of Mr. Hatherley&apos;s thumb, and that of Colonel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Warburton&apos;s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">served to weaken the effect.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>It was in the summer of &apos;89, not long after my marriage, that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">One morning, at a little before seven o&apos;clock, I was awakened by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tightly behind him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I&apos;ve got him here,&quot; he whispered, jerking his thumb over his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shoulder; &quot;he&apos;s all right.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What is it, then?&quot; I asked, for his manner suggested that it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It&apos;s a new patient,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I thought I&apos;d bring him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round myself; then he couldn&apos;t slip away. There he is, all safe</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">same as you.&quot; And off he went, this trusty tout, without even</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">giving me time to thank him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strength of mind to control.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,&quot; said he, &quot;but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the side-table.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I took it up and glanced at it. &quot;Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).&quot; That was the name,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">style, and abode of my morning visitor. &quot;I regret that I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">kept you waiting,&quot; said I, sitting down in my library-chair. &quot;You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a monotonous occupation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,&quot; said he, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>instincts rose up against that laugh.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Stop it!&quot; I cried; &quot;pull yourself together!&quot; and I poured out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some water from a caraffe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">weary and pale-looking.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have been making a fool of myself,&quot; he gasped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not at all. Drink this.&quot; I dashed some brandy into the water,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That&apos;s better!&quot; said he. &quot;And now, Doctor, perhaps you would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">used to be.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the roots.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; I cried, &quot;this is a terrible injury. It must have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bled considerably.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">province.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This has been done,&quot; said I, examining the wound, &quot;by a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heavy and sharp instrument.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A thing like a cleaver,&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;An accident, I presume?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;By no means.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What! a murderous attack?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very murderous indeed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You horrify me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How is that?&quot; I asked when I had finished.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trying to your nerves.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha!&quot; cried I, &quot;if it is anything in the nature of a problem</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">official police.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, I have heard of that fellow,&quot; answered my visitor, &quot;and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an introduction to him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I&apos;ll do better. I&apos;ll take you round to him myself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I should be immensely obliged to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We&apos;ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instant.&quot; I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">new acquaintance to Baker Street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brandy and water within his reach.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Hatherley,&quot; said he. &quot;Pray, lie down there and make yourself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said my patient, &quot;but I have felt another man since</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">experiences.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which our visitor detailed to us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You must know,&quot; said he, &quot;that I am an orphan and a bachelor,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &amp;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money through my poor father&apos;s death, I determined to start in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">During two years I have had three consultations and one small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believe that I should never have any practice at all.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the name of &apos;Colonel Lysander Stark&apos; engraved upon it. Close at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thirty.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Mr. Hatherley?&apos; said he, with something of a German accent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and capable of preserving a secret.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">address. &apos;May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;That is quite correct,&apos; I answered; &apos;but you will excuse me if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that you wished to speak to me?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from one who lives in the bosom of his family.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;If I promise to keep a secret,&apos; said I, &apos;you may absolutely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">depend upon my doing so.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Do you promise, then?&apos; said he at last.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, I promise.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I have already given you my word.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Very good.&apos; He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">empty.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;That&apos;s all right,&apos; said he, coming back. &apos;I know that clerks are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sometimes curious as to their master&apos;s affairs. Now we can talk</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in safety.&apos; He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">showing my impatience.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I beg that you will state your business, sir,&apos; said I; &apos;my time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is of value.&apos; Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">words came to my lips.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;How would fifty guineas for a night&apos;s work suit you?&apos; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Most admirably.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I say a night&apos;s work, but an hour&apos;s would be nearer the mark. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">train.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Where to?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">train from Paddington which would bring you there at about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">11:15.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Very good.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;There is a drive, then?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seven miles from Eyford Station.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the night.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hour?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be to me. &apos;Not at all,&apos; said I, &apos;I shall be very happy to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eavesdroppers?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Entirely.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fuller&apos;s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in one or two places in England?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I have heard so.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">discover that there was a deposit of fuller&apos;s-earth in one of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I quite follow you,&apos; said I. &apos;The only point which I could not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in excavating fuller&apos;s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like gravel from a pit.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Ah!&apos; said he carelessly, &apos;we have our own process. We compress</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trust you.&apos; He rose as he spoke. &apos;I shall expect you, then, at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Eyford at 11:15.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I shall certainly be there.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And not a word to a soul.&apos; He looked at me with a last long,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grasp, he hurried from the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me, and I could not think that his explanation of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fuller&apos;s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o&apos;clock. I was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">horse could go.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One horse?&quot; interjected Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, only one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Did you observe the colour?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carriage. It was a chestnut.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Tired-looking or fresh?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, fresh and glossy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your most interesting statement.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drove away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lamp in his hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">few minutes,&apos; said he, throwing open another door. It was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">door. &apos;I shall not keep you waiting an instant,&apos; said he, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vanished into the darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I would go,&apos; said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">speak calmly; &apos;I would go. I should not stay here. There is no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">good for you to do.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;But, madam,&apos; said I, &apos;I have not yet done what I came for. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It is not worth your while to wait,&apos; she went on. &apos;You can pass</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through the door; no one hinders.&apos; And then, seeing that I smiled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. &apos;For the love</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Heaven!&apos; she whispered, &apos;get away from here before it is too</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">late!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as noiselessly as she had come.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;This is my secretary and manager,&apos; said the colonel. &apos;By the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">now. I fear that you have felt the draught.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;On the contrary,&apos; said I, &apos;I opened the door myself because I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">felt the room to be a little close.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. &apos;Perhaps we had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better proceed to business, then,&apos; said he. &apos;Mr. Ferguson and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will take you up to see the machine.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I had better put my hat on, I suppose.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, no, it is in the house.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What, you dig fuller&apos;s-earth in the house?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know what is wrong with it.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">least a fellow-countryman.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the colonel ushered me in.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;We are now,&apos; said he, &apos;actually within the hydraulic press, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it right.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller&apos;s-earth</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">colonel looking down at me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;What are you doing there?&apos; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that which he had told me. &apos;I was admiring your fuller&apos;s-earth,&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said I; &apos;I think that I should be better able to advise you as to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was used.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his grey eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Very well,&apos; said he, &apos;you shall know all about the machine.&apos; He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shoves. &apos;Hullo!&apos; I yelled. &apos;Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back to my heart.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">how narrow had been my escape.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Come! come!&apos; she cried breathlessly. &apos;They will be here in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the so-precious time, but come!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which <text:s/>we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her like one <text:s/>who is at her wit&apos;s end. Then she threw open a door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was shining brightly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It is your only chance,&apos; said she. &apos;It is high, but it may be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that you can jump it.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">butcher&apos;s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him and tried to hold him back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Fritz! Fritz!&apos; she cried in English, &apos;remember your promise</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">silent! Oh, he will be silent!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You are mad, Elise!&apos; he shouted, struggling to break away from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her. &apos;You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pass, I say!&apos; He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>garden below.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rose-bushes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">particulars of my night&apos;s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">miles off.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exactly what you advise.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">placed his cuttings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here is an advertisement which will interest you,&quot; said he. &quot;It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">o&apos;clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressed in,&apos; etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried my patient. &quot;Then that explains what the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">girl said.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Eyford.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for its centre.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There you are,&quot; said he. &quot;That circle is drawn at a radius of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was an hour&apos;s good drive.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And you think that they brought you back all that way when you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were unconscious?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been lifted and conveyed somewhere.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What I cannot understand,&quot; said I, &quot;is why they should have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman&apos;s entreaties.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in my life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,&quot; said Bradstreet. &quot;Well, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think I could lay my finger on it,&quot; said Holmes quietly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Really, now!&quot; cried the inspector, &quot;you have formed your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">south, for the country is more deserted there.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And I say east,&quot; said my patient.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am for west,&quot; remarked the plain-clothes man. &quot;There are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">several quiet little villages up there.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And I am for north,&quot; said I, &quot;because there are no hills there,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Come,&quot; cried the inspector, laughing; &quot;it&apos;s a very pretty</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you give your casting vote to?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;You are all wrong.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But we can&apos;t all be.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.&quot; He placed his finger in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">centre of the circle. &quot;This is where we shall find them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But the twelve-mile drive?&quot; gasped Hatherley.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,&quot; observed Bradstreet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thoughtfully. &quot;Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of this gang.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None at all,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;They are coiners on a large scale,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">place of silver.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said the inspector. &quot;They have been turning out half-crowns by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A house on fire?&quot; asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again on its way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; said the station-master.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When did it break out?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the whole place is in a blaze.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Whose house is it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Dr. Becher&apos;s.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Tell me,&quot; broke in the engineer, &quot;is Dr. Becher a German, very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thin, with a long, sharp nose?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The station-master laughed heartily. &quot;No, sir, Dr. Becher is an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Englishman, and there isn&apos;t a man in the parish who has a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">keep the flames under.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That&apos;s it!&quot; cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. &quot;There is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">second window is the one that I jumped from.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, at least,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;you have had your revenge upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a good hundred miles off by now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">And Holmes&apos; fears came to be realised, for from that day to this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whereabouts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">already referred to.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the way of danger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well,&quot; said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once more to London, &quot;it has been a pretty business for me! I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have I gained?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Experience,&quot; said Holmes, laughing. &quot;Indirectly it may be of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">existence.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this remarkable episode.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">noble correspondent could be.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here is a very fashionable epistle,&quot; I remarked as he entered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fish-monger and a tide-waiter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">answered, smiling, &quot;and the humbler are usually the more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not social, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, distinctly professional.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And from a noble client?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;One of the highest in England.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear fellow, I congratulate you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">papers diligently of late, have you not?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It looks like it,&quot; said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the corner. &quot;I have had nothing else to do.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wedding?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This is what he says:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o&apos;clock in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the outer side of his right little finger,&quot; remarked Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as he folded up the epistle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He says four o&apos;clock. It is three now. He will be here in an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hour.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is.&quot; He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reference beside the mantelpiece. &quot;Here he is,&quot; said he, sitting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down and flattening it out upon his knee. &quot;&apos;Lord Robert Walsingham</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.&apos; Hum! &apos;Arms:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He&apos;s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more solid.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,&quot; said I,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">intrusion of other matters.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">newspaper selections.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back: &apos;A marriage has been arranged,&apos; it says, &apos;and will, if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.&apos; That is all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Terse and to the point,&quot; remarked Holmes, stretching his long,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thin legs towards the fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: &apos;There will soon be a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call for protection in the marriage market, for the present</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for over twenty years proof against the little god&apos;s arrows, has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">British peeress.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Anything else?&quot; asked Holmes, yawning.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be at St. George&apos;s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Backwater&apos;s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Before the what?&quot; asked Holmes with a start.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The vanishing of the lady.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When did she vanish, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;At the wedding breakfast.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dramatic, in fact.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as this. Pray let me have the details.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I warn you that they are very incomplete.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Perhaps we may make them less so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">headed, &apos;Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding&apos;:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is a common subject for conversation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The ceremony, which was performed at St. George&apos;s, Hanover</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disappearance of the bride.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And is that all?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a suggestive one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And it is--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">public press.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if only as a check to my own memory.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Lord Robert St. Simon,&quot; announced our page-boy, throwing open</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">golden eyeglasses.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good-day, Lord St. Simon,&quot; said Holmes, rising and bowing. &quot;Pray</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter over.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">society.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, I am descending.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I beg pardon.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My last client of the sort was a king.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;The King of Scandinavia.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What! Had he lost his wife?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You can understand,&quot; said Holmes suavely, &quot;that I extend to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you in yours.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Of course! Very right! very right! I&apos;m sure I beg pardon. As to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assist you in forming an opinion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lord St. Simon glanced over it. &quot;Yes, it is correct, as far as it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">goes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">directly by questioning you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray do so.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In San Francisco, a year ago.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You were travelling in the States?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Did you become engaged then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you were on a friendly footing?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">amused.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Her father is very rich?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And how did he make his money?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady&apos;s--your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wife&apos;s character?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into the fire. &quot;You see, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he, &quot;my wife was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">name which I have the honour to bear&quot;--he gave a little stately</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cough--&quot;had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have you her photograph?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I brought this with me.&quot; He opened a locket and showed us the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">acquaintance?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">married her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fait accompli?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I really have made no inquiries on the subject.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wedding?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Was she in good spirits?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">future lives.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wedding?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She was as bright as possible--at least until after the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ceremony.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And did you observe any change in her then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bearing upon the case.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray let us have it, for all that.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fell over into the pew. There was a moment&apos;s delay, but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the general public were present, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">open.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This gentleman was not one of your wife&apos;s friends?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on re-entering her father&apos;s house?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I saw her in conversation with her maid.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And who is her maid?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A confidential servant?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look upon these things in a different way.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How long did she speak to this Alice?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You did not overhear what they said?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Lady St. Simon said something about &apos;jumping a claim.&apos; She was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">meant.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She walked into the breakfast-room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On your arm?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never came back.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her room, covered her bride&apos;s dress with a long ulster, put on a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bonnet, and went out.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran&apos;s house that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and your relations to her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mr. Doran&apos;s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">row.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Did your wife hear all this?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, thank goodness, she did not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some terrible trap for her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, it is a possible supposition.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You think so, too?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this as likely?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what is your own theory as to what took place?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disturbance in my wife.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes, smiling. &quot;And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We could see the other side of the road and the Park.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I shall communicate with you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,&quot; said our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">client, rising.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have solved it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Eh? What was that?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I say that I have solved it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where, then, is my wife?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lord St. Simon shook his head. &quot;I am afraid that it will take</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wiser heads than yours or mine,&quot; he remarked, and bowing in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it on a level with his own,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. &quot;I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case before our client came into the room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau&apos;s example.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But I have heard all that you have heard.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cigars in the box.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What&apos;s up, then?&quot; asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. &quot;You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look dissatisfied.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Really! You surprise me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And very wet it seems to have made you,&quot; said Holmes laying his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In heaven&apos;s name, what for?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why? What do you mean?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the one as in the other.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. &quot;I suppose you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know all about it,&quot; he snarled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the matter?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think it very unlikely.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this in it?&quot; He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shoes and a bride&apos;s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in water. &quot;There,&quot; said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">top of the pile. &quot;There is a little nut for you to crack, Master</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You dragged them from the Serpentine?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;By the same brilliant reasoning, every man&apos;s body is to be found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to arrive at through this?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am afraid that you will find it difficult.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Are you, indeed, now?&quot; cried Lestrade with some bitterness. &quot;I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And how?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">card-case is a note. And here is the very note.&quot; He slapped it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down upon the table in front of him. &quot;Listen to this: &apos;You will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.&apos; Now my theory all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into her hand at the door and which lured her within their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reach.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very good, Lestrade,&quot; said Holmes, laughing. &quot;You really are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very fine indeed. Let me see it.&quot; He took up the paper in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gave a little cry of satisfaction. &quot;This is indeed important,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha! you find it so?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. &quot;Why,&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shrieked, &quot;you&apos;re looking at the wrong side!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On the contrary, this is the right side.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The right side? You&apos;re mad! Here is the note written in pencil</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over here.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bill, which interests me deeply.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There&apos;s nothing in it. I looked at it before,&quot; said Lestrade.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">6d., glass sherry, 8d.&apos; I see nothing in that.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">congratulate you again.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I&apos;ve wasted time enough,&quot; said Lestrade, rising. &quot;I believe in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the matter first.&quot; He gathered up the garments, thrust them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>into the bag, and made for the door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Just one hint to you, Lestrade,&quot; drawled Holmes before his rival</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vanished; &quot;I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">such person.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurried away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his overcoat. &quot;There is something in what the fellow says about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outdoor work,&quot; he remarked, &quot;so I think, Watson, that I must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leave you to your papers for a little.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was after five o&apos;clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confectioner&apos;s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for and were ordered to this address.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Just before nine o&apos;clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conclusions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They have laid the supper, then,&quot; he said, rubbing his hands.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,&quot; said he. &quot;I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My messenger reached you, then?&quot; asked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Have you good authority for what you say?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The best possible.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forehead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What will the Duke say,&quot; he murmured, &quot;when he hears that one of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the family has been subjected to such humiliation?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">humiliation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had no one to advise her at such a crisis.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was a slight, sir, a public slight,&quot; said Lord St. Simon,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tapping his fingers upon the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unprecedented a position.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been shamefully used.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that I heard a ring,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Yes, there are steps</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who may be more successful.&quot; He opened the door and ushered in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lady and gentleman. &quot;Lord St. Simon,&quot; said he &quot;allow me to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think, you have already met.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one which it was hard to resist.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You&apos;re angry, Robert,&quot; said she. &quot;Well, I guess you have every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cause to be.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray make no apology to me,&quot; said Lord St. Simon bitterly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">didn&apos;t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn&apos;t</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the room while you explain this matter?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If I may give an opinion,&quot; remarked the strange gentleman,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;we&apos;ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hear the rights of it.&quot; He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I&apos;ll tell our story right away,&quot; said the lady. &quot;Frank here</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I met in &apos;84, in McQuire&apos;s camp, near the Rockies, where pa</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wouldn&apos;t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me away to &apos;Frisco. Frank wouldn&apos;t throw up his hand, though; so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Why shouldn&apos;t we be married right away, then,&apos; said he, &apos;and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then I will feel sure of you; and I won&apos;t claim to be your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">husband until I come back?&apos; Well, we talked it over, and he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his fortune, and I went back to pa.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">miners&apos; camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my Frank&apos;s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me to half the doctors in &apos;Frisco. Not a word of news came for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to &apos;Frisco, and we came to London,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I&apos;d have done</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my duty by him. We can&apos;t command our love, but we can our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">didn&apos;t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ear. I didn&apos;t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">run away and explain afterwards. I hadn&apos;t been at the table ten</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very morning of my second wedding.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I saw it in a paper,&quot; explained the American. &quot;It gave the name</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the church but not where the lady lived.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">meanly of me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">long narrative.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; he said, &quot;but it is not my custom to discuss my most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">intimate personal affairs in this public manner.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then you won&apos;t forgive me? You won&apos;t shake hands before I go?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.&quot; He put out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I had hoped,&quot; suggested Holmes, &quot;that you would have joined us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in a friendly supper.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that there you ask a little too much,&quot; responded his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lordship. &quot;I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very good-night.&quot; He included us all in a sweeping bow and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stalked out of the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>company,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes. &quot;It is always a joy to meet an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The case has been an interesting one,&quot; remarked Holmes when our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">visitors had left us, &quot;because it serves to show very clearly how</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Lestrade of Scotland Yard.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You were not yourself at fault at all, then?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">because she had spent so short a time in this country that she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">American. Then who could this American be, and why should he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before I ever heard Lord St. Simon&apos;s narrative. When he told us</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride&apos;s manner, of so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners&apos; parlance</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">means taking possession of that which another person has a prior</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And how in the world did you find them?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">information in his hands the value of which he did not himself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How did you deduce the select?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">better in every way that they should make their position a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">made him keep the appointment.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But with no very good result,&quot; I remarked. &quot;His conduct was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainly not very gracious.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, smiling, &quot;perhaps you would not be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these bleak autumnal evenings.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Holmes,&quot; said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down the street, &quot;here is a madman coming along. It seems rather</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">extraordinary contortions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What on earth can be the matter with him?&quot; I asked. &quot;He is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">looking up at the numbers of the houses.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I believe that he is coming here,&quot; said Holmes, rubbing his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>hands.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?&quot; As</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clanging.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any little problem which you may submit to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No doubt you think me mad?&quot; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see that you have had some great trouble,&quot; responded Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out of this horrible affair.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray compose yourself, sir,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;and let me have a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My name,&quot; answered our visitor, &quot;is probably familiar to your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &amp;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">himself to tell his story.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;I feel that time is of value,&quot; said he; &quot;that is why I hastened</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">during the last few years, and there are many noble families to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pictures, libraries, or plate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quickly through a disagreeable task.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Mr. Holder,&apos; said he, &apos;I have been informed that you are in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">habit of advancing money.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The firm does so when the security is good.&apos; I answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It is absolutely essential to me,&apos; said he, &apos;that I should have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one&apos;s self under obligations.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?&apos; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money should be paid at once.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">own private purse,&apos; said I, &apos;were it not that the strain would be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be taken.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I should much prefer to have it so,&apos; said he, raising up a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Precisely.&apos; He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which he had named. &apos;There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,&apos; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he, &apos;and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">security.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perplexity from it to my illustrious client.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You doubt its value?&apos; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Not at all. I only doubt--&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Ample.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call for it in person on Monday morning.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">once more to my work.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers&apos; safes had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">meant it for the best.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman&apos;s quick insight into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">character.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I shall continue with my miserable story.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Where have you put it?&apos; asked Arthur.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;In my own bureau.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well, I hope to goodness the house won&apos;t be burgled during the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">night.&apos; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It is locked up,&apos; I answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a very grave face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Look here, dad,&apos; said he with his eyes cast down, &apos;can you let</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me have 200 pounds?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, I cannot!&apos; I answered sharply. &apos;I have been far too</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">generous with you in money matters.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You have been very kind,&apos; said he, &apos;but I must have this money,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or else I can never show my face inside the club again.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And a very good thing, too!&apos; I cried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he. &apos;I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other means.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">month. &apos;You shall not have a farthing from me,&apos; I cried, on which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he bowed and left the room without another word.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I approached.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;&apos;Tell me, dad,&apos; said she, looking, I thought, a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disturbed, &apos;did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-night?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Certainly not.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it is hardly safe and should be stopped.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Quite sure, dad.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Then, good-night.&apos; I kissed her and went up to my bedroom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again, where I was soon asleep.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me upon any point which I do not make clear.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impression behind it as though a window had gently closed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Arthur!&apos; I screamed, &apos;you villain! you thief! How dare you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">touch that coronet?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">three of the beryls in it, was missing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You blackguard!&apos; I shouted, beside myself with rage. &apos;You have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jewels which you have stolen?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Stolen!&apos; he cried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, thief!&apos; I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,&apos; said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tear off another piece?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You have called me names enough,&apos; said he, &apos;I will not stand it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the morning and make my own way in the world.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You shall leave it in the hands of the police!&apos; I cried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">half-mad with grief and rage. &apos;I shall have this matter probed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the bottom.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You shall learn nothing from me,&apos; said he with a passion such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as I should not have thought was in his nature. &apos;If you choose to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">call the police, let the police find what they can.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur&apos;s face, she read the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">national property. I was determined that the law should have its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way in everything.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;At least,&apos; said he, &apos;you will not have me arrested at once. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house for five minutes.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have stolen,&apos; said I. And then, realising the dreadful position</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me what he had done with the three missing stones.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You may as well face the matter,&apos; said I; &apos;you have been caught</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,&apos; he answered,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The police have openly confessed that they can at present make</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>in one night. Oh, what shall I do!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beyond words.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you receive much company?&quot; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Arthur&apos;s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one else, I think.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you go out much in society?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is unusual in a young girl.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is four-and-twenty.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her also.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Terrible! She is even more affected than I.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have neither of you any doubt as to your son&apos;s guilt?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in his hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the coronet at all injured?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, it was twisted.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">straighten it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">singular points about the case. What did the police think of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">noise which awoke you from your sleep?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They considered that it might be caused by Arthur&apos;s closing his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bedroom door.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disappearance of these gems?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the hope of finding them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have they thought of looking outside the house?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">already been minutely examined.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, my dear sir,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;is it not obvious to you now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But what other is there?&quot; cried the banker with a gesture of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">despair. &quot;If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is our task to find that out,&quot; replied Holmes; &quot;so now, if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">details.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confess that the guilt of the banker&apos;s son appeared to me to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">faith in Holmes&apos; judgment that I felt that there must be some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">residence of the great financier.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tradesmen&apos;s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">front, down the tradesmen&apos;s path, and so round by the garden</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seen such deadly paleness in a woman&apos;s face. Her lips, too, were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">over his head with a sweet womanly caress.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not, dad?&quot; she asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be sorry for having acted so harshly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suspect him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the coronet in his hand?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prison!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down from London to inquire more deeply into it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This gentleman?&quot; she asked, facing round to me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the stable lane now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The stable lane?&quot; She raised her dark eyebrows. &quot;What can he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prove it,&quot; returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">snow from his shoes. &quot;I believe I have the honour of addressing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You heard nothing yourself last night?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that, and I came down.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fasten all the windows?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Were they all fastened this morning?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who may have heard uncle&apos;s remarks about the coronet.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But what is the good of all these vague theories,&quot; cried the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">banker impatiently, &quot;when I have told you that I saw Arthur with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the coronet in his hands?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">presume?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you know him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His name is Francis Prosper.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He stood,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;to the left of the door--that is to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, he did.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And he is a man with a wooden leg?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Something like fear sprang up in the young lady&apos;s expressive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">black eyes. &quot;Why, you are like a magician,&quot; said she. &quot;How do you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know that?&quot; She smiled, but there was no answering smile in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes&apos; thin, eager face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I should be very glad now to go upstairs,&quot; said he. &quot;I shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with his powerful magnifying lens. &quot;Now we shall go upstairs,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he at last.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>The banker&apos;s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Which key was used to open it?&quot; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lumber-room.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have you it here?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is it on the dressing-table.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is a noiseless lock,&quot; said he. &quot;It is no wonder that it did</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have a look at it.&quot; He opened the case, and taking out the diadem</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jeweller&apos;s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Now, Mr. Holder,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;here is the corner which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beg that you will break it off.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The banker recoiled in horror. &quot;I should not dream of trying,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said he.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then I will.&quot; Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without result. &quot;I feel it give a little,&quot; said he; &quot;but, though</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing of it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Miss Holder?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I confess that I still share my uncle&apos;s perplexity.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outside.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holder,&quot; said he; &quot;I can serve you best by returning to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rooms.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot tell.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The banker wrung his hands. &quot;I shall never see them again!&quot; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cried. &quot;And my son? You give me hopes?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My opinion is in no way altered.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, for God&apos;s sake, what was this dark business which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">acted in my house last night?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">place no limit on the sum I may draw.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I would give my fortune to have them back.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">again before evening.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was obvious to me that my companion&apos;s mind was now made up</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a perfect sample of the class.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that this should do,&quot; said he, glancing into the glass</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">above the fireplace. &quot;I only wish that you could come with me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson, but I fear that it won&apos;t do. I may be on the trail in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this matter, or I may be following a will-o&apos;-the-wisp, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hours.&quot; He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cup of tea.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I only looked in as I passed,&quot; said he. &quot;I am going right on.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Where to?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">before I get back. Don&apos;t wait up for me in case I should be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">late.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;How are you getting on?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">respectable self.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">congenial hunt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other, as fresh and trim as possible.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Why, it is after nine now,&quot; I answered. &quot;I should not be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the armchair which I pushed forward for him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he. &quot;Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mary, has deserted me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Deserted you?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in this note:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">points to suicide?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your troubles.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">learned something! Where are the gems?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I would pay ten.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have it!&quot; he gasped. &quot;I am saved! I am saved!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,&quot; said Sherlock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes rather sternly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Owe!&quot; He caught up a pen. &quot;Name the sum, and I will pay it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then it was not Arthur who took them?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know that the truth is known.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lips.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;For heaven&apos;s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mystery!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fled together.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My Mary? Impossible!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him nearly every evening.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I cannot, and I will not, believe it!&quot; cried the banker with an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ashen face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about one of the servants&apos; escapade with her wooden-legged lover,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which was all perfectly true.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to where he stood hid behind the curtain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">appeared upon the scene.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Is it possible?&quot; gasped the banker.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">secret.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coronet,&quot; cried Mr. Holder. &quot;Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;When I arrived at the house,&quot; continued Holmes, &quot;I at once went</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen&apos;s path, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">front of me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was it brought him the coronet?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">became a certainty.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">own family.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George&apos;s house,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said Mr. Holder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. &apos;Why,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dash it all!&apos; said he, &apos;I&apos;ve let them go at six hundred for the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">three!&apos; I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o&apos;clock, after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what I may call a really hard day&apos;s work.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the banker, rising. &quot;Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I think that we may safely say,&quot; returned Holmes, &quot;that she is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sufficient punishment.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;To the man who loves art for its own sake,&quot; remarked Sherlock</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Telegraph, &quot;it is frequently in its least important and lowliest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this truth that in these little records of our cases which you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my special province.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And yet,&quot; said I, smiling, &quot;I cannot quite hold myself absolved</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">records.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have erred, perhaps,&quot; he observed, taking up a glowing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disputatious rather than a meditative mood--&quot;you have erred</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really the only notable feature about the thing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">friend&apos;s singular character.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No, it is not selfishness or conceit,&quot; said he, answering, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. &quot;If I claim full</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lectures into a series of tales.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;At the same time,&quot; he remarked after a pause, during which he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The end may have been so,&quot; I answered, &quot;but the methods I hold</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to have been novel and of interest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">zero-point, I fancy. Read it!&quot; He tossed a crumpled letter across</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ran thus:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="47"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">&quot;VIOLET HUNTER.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you know the young lady?&quot; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Not I.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is half-past ten now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It may be so in this case, also.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">freckled like a plover&apos;s egg, and with the brisk manner of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woman who has had her own way to make in the world.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,&quot; said she, as my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">companion rose to greet her, &quot;but I have had a very strange</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">kind enough to tell me what I should do.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that I can to serve you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have been a governess for five years,&quot; said she, &quot;in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">children over to America with him, so that I found myself without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without success. At last the little money which I had saved began</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to run short, and I was at my wit&apos;s end as to what I should do.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">called Westaway&apos;s, and there I used to call about once a week in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;That will do,&apos; said he; &apos;I could not ask for anything better.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Capital! capital!&apos; He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;You are looking for a situation, miss?&apos; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, sir.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;As governess?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Yes, sir.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And what salary do you ask?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Munro.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!&apos; he cried, throwing his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passion. &apos;How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">such attractions and accomplishments?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,&apos; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Tut, tut!&apos; he cried. &apos;This is all quite beside the question.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opened a pocket-book and took out a note.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It is also my custom,&apos; said he, smiling in the most pleasant</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the white creases of his face, &apos;to advance to my young ladies</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a little more before I quite committed myself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;May I ask where you live, sir?&apos; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!&apos; He leaned back</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was a little startled at the nature of the child&apos;s amusement,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but the father&apos;s laughter made me think that perhaps he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">joking.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;My sole duties, then,&apos; I asked, &apos;are to take charge of a single</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">child?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,&apos; he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cried. &apos;Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">always that they were such commands as a lady might with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I should be happy to make myself useful.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Heh?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No,&apos; said I, considerably astonished at his words.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, no.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I am afraid that that is quite impossible,&apos; said I. He had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shadow pass over his face as I spoke.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I am afraid that it is quite essential,&apos; said he. &apos;It is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little fancy of my wife&apos;s, and ladies&apos; fancies, you know, madam,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ladies&apos; fancies must be consulted. And so you won&apos;t cut your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hair?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, sir, I really could not,&apos; I answered firmly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pity, because in other respects you would really have done very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of your young ladies.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?&apos; she asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;If you please, Miss Stoper.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">most excellent offers in this fashion,&apos; said she sharply. &apos;You</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.&apos; She struck a gong</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here and I will read it to you:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:s text:c="23"/><text:span text:style-name="T1">&quot;&apos;The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that before taking the final step I should like to submit the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">whole matter to your consideration.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">question,&quot; said Holmes, smiling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But you would not advise me to refuse?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see a sister of mine apply for.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">formed some opinion?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outbreak?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nice household for a young lady.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strong reason behind.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or in danger--&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Danger! What danger do you foresee?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes shook his head gravely. &quot;It would cease to be a danger if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we could define it,&quot; said he. &quot;But at any time, day or night, a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">telegram would bring me down to your help.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is enough.&quot; She rose briskly from her chair with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anxiety all swept from her face. &quot;I shall go down to Hampshire</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-morrow.&quot; With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">good-night and bustled off upon her way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;At least,&quot; said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the stairs, &quot;she seems to be a young lady who is very well able</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to take care of herself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And she would need to be,&quot; said Holmes gravely. &quot;I am much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was not very long before my friend&apos;s prediction was fulfilled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand when I mentioned it. &quot;Data! data! data!&quot; he cried</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impatiently. &quot;I can&apos;t make bricks without clay.&quot; And yet he would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have accepted such a situation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The telegram which we eventually received came late one night</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,&quot; said he, and turned back</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to his chemical studies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The summons was a brief and urgent one.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to-morrow,&quot; it said. &quot;Do come! I am at my wit&apos;s end. <text:s/>HUNTER.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Will you come with me?&quot; asked Holmes, glancing up.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I should wish to.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Just look it up, then.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There is a train at half-past nine,&quot; said I, glancing over my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Bradshaw. &quot;It is due at Winchester at 11:30.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">By eleven o&apos;clock the next day we were well upon our way to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which set an edge to a man&apos;s energy. All over the countryside,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">green of the new foliage.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Are they not fresh and beautiful?&quot; I cried with all the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But Holmes shook his head gravely.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Do you know, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;that it is one of the curses of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; I cried. &quot;Who would associate crime with these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dear old homesteads?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You horrify me!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a drunkard&apos;s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not personally threatened.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Quite so. She has her freedom.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to tell.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">distance from the station, and there we found the young lady</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>awaited us upon the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am so delighted that you have come,&quot; she said earnestly. &quot;It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray tell us what has happened to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Let us have everything in its due order.&quot; Holmes thrust his long</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I am not easy in my mind about them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What can you not understand?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Southerton&apos;s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">front of the hall door has given its name to the place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">conversation I have gathered that they have been married about</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">father&apos;s young wife.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has little to do with my story.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am glad of all details,&quot; remarked my friend, &quot;whether they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seem to you to be relevant or not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">corner of the building.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">breakfast and whispered something to her husband.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, yes,&apos; said he, turning to me, &apos;we are very much obliged to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">both be extremely obliged.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">along the entire front of the house, with three long windows</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the nursery.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Two days later this same performance was gone through under</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to change my dress.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Jephro,&apos; said she, &apos;there is an impertinent fellow upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?&apos; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, I know no one in these parts.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him to go away.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Surely it would be better to take no notice.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">round and wave him away like that.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">seen the man in the road.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Pray continue,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Your narrative promises to be a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">most interesting one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prove to be little relation between the different incidents of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">about.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Look in here!&apos; said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">planks. &apos;Is he not a beauty?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vague figure huddled up in the darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Don&apos;t be frightened,&apos; said my employer, laughing at the start</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which I had given. &apos;It&apos;s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon. For goodness&apos; sake don&apos;t you ever on any pretext set your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">foot over the threshold at night, for it&apos;s as much as your life</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is worth.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">look out of my bedroom window about two o&apos;clock in the morning.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think that any burglar could have done.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">locked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his face which made him a very different person to the round,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without a word or a look.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Ah!&apos; said he, &apos;you must not think me rude if I passed you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business matters.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I assured him that I was not offended. &apos;By the way,&apos; said I,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of them has the shutters up.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at my remark.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Photography is one of my hobbies,&apos; said he. &apos;I have made my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">believed it?&apos; He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">annoyance, but no jest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">place. They talk of woman&apos;s instinct; perhaps it was woman&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forbidden door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opened the door, and slipped through.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">outside.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;So,&apos; said he, smiling, &apos;it was you, then. I thought that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">must be when I saw the door open.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Oh, I am so frightened!&apos; I panted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;My dear young lady! my dear young lady!&apos;--you cannot think how</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">caressing and soothing his manner was--&apos;and what has frightened</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you, my dear young lady?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was keenly on my guard against him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,&apos; I answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Only that?&apos; said he, looking at me keenly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Why, what did you think?&apos; I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Why do you think that I lock this door?&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I am sure that I do not know.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">see?&apos; He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;I am sure if I had known--&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;&apos;Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that threshold again&apos;--here in an instant the smile hardened into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">demon--&apos;I&apos;ll throw you to the mastiff.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">morning, but I must be back before three o&apos;clock, for Mr. and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">do.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Is Toller still drunk?&quot; he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nothing with him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, the wine-cellar.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">think you a quite exceptional woman.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will try. What is it?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o&apos;clock, my friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">matters immensely.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will do it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">brought there to personate someone, and the real person is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">friend of hers--possibly her fiancé--and no doubt, as you wore</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the girl&apos;s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the child.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;What on earth has that to do with it?&quot; I ejaculated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">parents. Don&apos;t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">frequently gained my first real insight into the character of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">parents by studying their children. This child&apos;s disposition is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty&apos;s sake, and whether he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">power.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,&quot; cried our client. &quot;A</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this poor creature.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man. We can do nothing until seven o&apos;clock. At that hour we shall</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mystery.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">standing smiling on the door-step.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Have you managed it?&quot; asked Holmes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. &quot;That is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mrs. Toller in the cellar,&quot; said she. &quot;Her husband lies snoring</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Mr. Rucastle&apos;s.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have done well indeed!&quot; cried Holmes with enthusiasm. &quot;Now</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">business.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes&apos; face clouded over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I trust that we are not too late,&quot; said he. &quot;I think, Miss</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way in.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;There has been some villainy here,&quot; said Holmes; &quot;this beauty</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has guessed Miss Hunter&apos;s intentions and has carried his victim</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">off.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But how?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.&quot; He</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">swung himself up onto the roof. &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; he cried, &quot;here&apos;s the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But it is impossible,&quot; said Miss Hunter; &quot;the ladder was not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there when the Rucastles went away.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">confronted him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You villain!&quot; said he, &quot;where&apos;s your daughter?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">skylight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;It is for me to ask you that,&quot; he shrieked, &quot;you thieves! Spies</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I&apos;ll</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">serve you!&quot; He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">could go.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;He&apos;s gone for the dog!&quot; cried Miss Hunter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I have my revolver,&quot; said I.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Better close the front door,&quot; cried Holmes, and we all rushed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at a side door.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;My God!&quot; he cried. &quot;Someone has loosed the dog. It&apos;s not been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it&apos;ll be too late!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">black muzzle buried in Rucastle&apos;s throat, while he writhed and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mrs. Toller!&quot; cried Miss Hunter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn&apos;t let me know</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were wasted.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ha!&quot; said Holmes, looking keenly at her. &quot;It is clear that Mrs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I will soon make it clear to you,&quot; said she; &quot;and I&apos;d have done</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">so before now if I could ha&apos; got out from the cellar. If there&apos;s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">police-court business over this, you&apos;ll remember that I was the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice&apos;s friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">too.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn&apos;t, from the time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend&apos;s house. As well as I could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle&apos;s hands. He knew he was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">her money. When she wouldn&apos;t do it, he kept on worrying her until</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death&apos;s door. Then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">beautiful hair cut off; but that didn&apos;t make no change in her</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;I think that what you have been good enough</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">system of imprisonment?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;That was it, sir.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interests were the same as his.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,&quot; said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Mrs. Toller serenely.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;And in this way he managed that your good man should have no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">when your master had gone out.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;You have it, sir, just as it happened.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">questionable one.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">probably know so much of Rucastle&apos;s past life that he finds it</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.</text:p>
